CORYAT'S CRUDITIES

1 departed from the foresaid place where l lay all night
upon the water, about seven of the elocke in the morning
the eight and twentieth of September beeing wednesdey,
and orme to a haven towne of Zeland orllod Armu, about
sixe of the clocke at night. This daies joumey was nine
miles. The inhabitants of this island were informer timer
called Mattiaci, which are mentioned by Cornelius Tacitus
As for the Island it selfe wberein this Towne, Middle·
borough, and Flushing stand, it is commonly called
Walcheren. In this towne of Aemu 1 sawe nothing

which 1 did observe 1 will relate. For 1 will not do this
goodly Citie that wrong as to write so copiously of many
other Cities, and nothing at all of her.

Middleburg. Middleborough hath her denominatiou from a Noble
Roman Consul called Metellus, who is said to have bene
the first founder of it. For some do call it in Latin
Metelburgum quasi Metellibur , that is, the towne of
Metellus. It rs strongly ed, beautified with faire
