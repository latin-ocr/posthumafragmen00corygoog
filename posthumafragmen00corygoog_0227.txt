of the country. Some from Heydelbeern, that is, myrtle
trees, which doe yet grow plentifully upon the hilles about

the City. of this o inion is that learned Paulus Melissus,

who calleth Heidelberg urbem mgnileti. Againe there

are others that draw the name om the Dutch word
Heyden, that signifieth a Nation, beoeuse this place was

ever wel inhabited with people by reason of theo por-
tunity of the seate. Moreover there are some that me

it is called Heidelberg quasi Adelberg, that is, a noble

· City, in regatd of the nobility, the elegancie, and sweet-
nesse of the situation thereof. Where ore seeing there is

so great diversi of opinions amongst the learned about

the derivation 0 the name, l will not dis ute the matter
which is best or worst, but referre it to he discussed by

the learned censure of the judicious render. Truly the
situation thereos is very delectable and pleasant. For it
standeth in convalli inter huces montium, that is, in a
narrow valley which is on both sides beset with hils, and
those very commodious. For they are planted with many
fruitfnll vineyards. Also it is most pleasantly watered

river with the famous river Neccarus, otherwise called Ninus,
‘⁸ that runneth by the north side of the city. And it is of
so great note, that they commonly esteeme it the third
river of Germany next to the Danubius and the Rhene.

It riseth in Suevia even in the black Forrest which is ealled

in Latin Nigra Sylva about the space of foure houres
journey from the fountaine of Danubius, and at length
exonerateth it selfe into the Rhene, being before multiphed

with some other rivers, as the Cocharus and the laxus,
which doe infuse themselves into the Neccar not farre from

the towne of Wimpina in Suevia abovesaid lobserved

a goodly wooden bridge built over the Necmr, the fiirest
certainly that Ι saw ιιι Germany, but not the longest,
