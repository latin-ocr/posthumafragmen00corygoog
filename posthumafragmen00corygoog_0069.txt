CORYAT'S CRUDITIES

celebrated in two little Cbappels on both sides of the
Quire. Where I noted two exceeding cttrious railes at

[p. 345·] the entrance of them, the pillars whereof are made of
white and blacke marble, and the upper part ex versicolore
marmore.

Ttemsosrhe The roofe over the Quire is very beautifully concamer-

choir. ared, and richly gilt. Round about the upper end of the
Qire there is as exquisite a peece of worke as ever Ι saw
of that kinde. For a certaine cunning artifices called
Franciscus de Ferreo monte hath with extraordinary
curiosity contrived the history of the meation of the
world, and many other histories of the old Testament in
wainscot. So rare a worke that it is most admirable to

behold. There are also two very rich paire of Organs
on both sides without the Quire, most sumptuously gilt,
and imbossed with many very excellent workes.

At the west end of the Church right o site to the

Qire, 1 saw a ysassing faire and auncrent abricke, built

of sundry kin s of marble, wherein are baptized the
children of Noblemen onely. It is an admirable archi-
tfictme,fraysted}y1nto such fanlheigtyruylcrlat ithd⁰th.⁰‘'⁸¹¹ tgutgh

It is built round nid adorned with sixe partitions of little
marble pillars whereof many are Porphyrie, each partition

about the middle ofthe vorke sixe alabaster images round
about the same, being distant asunder by an equall dis-
tance. The dore at the entrance is made of brasse, and
contrived like a Latteise window. Ι observed in a redde
marble stone, which is about the foot of this rare worke‚
a notable thin which is not to be omitted, even the true
resemblance oia serpent, formed more exquisitely in the
stone by the hand of nature her selfe the most cunning
architect of all, then the most curious artificer in the world
could possibly have done. A thing that was shewed me
[p. μά] by an Italian, as a matter very wortby my observation.
