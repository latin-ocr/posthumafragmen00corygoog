OBSERVATIONS OF VERONA

beene in times past accounted oue of their twelve cities
on this side the Apennine mountaines. But afterwards
in processe of time, the Gaules that are called Senones,
luwing passed over the Alpes under the conduct of their
Captarne Brennus, came into this part of Italy, and ejected
those Hetruscans out of the possession thereos, and greatly
amplihed and enlarged the same. so that it was called
Verona quasi Brenona‚ from their Ca taine Brennus. But
there are some that write, that itha the denomination of
Verona from Vera, the name of a noble familie amongst
the Henusmns. Surely it is a very delectable, large, and
populous citie, and most sweetely seated :.for the noble
river Athesis tunneth by it which Virgil calleth amoenus,

This river yeeldeth a speciall commoditie to the citie. w '¹⁸⁰²'

For although it be not able to beare vessels of a great “³³⁸''

brudeo, yet it carrieth prety barges of convenient quan·

the city, both out of Germany and from Venice 1t selfe.
ln one side of this river, Ι told nineteene water-mils, which
vae like to those that Ι saw upon the river Rhodanus at
the city of Lyons. There are foure bridges which joyne
together both the bankes of the river, whereof one is very
farre and beautifull above the rest. B the sides of that
bridge that Ι passed over when Ι entr into the city from

Vicenza, Ι 0 served two faire stones of white marble ‘lm'sm‘

opposite to each other, with armes and scutchins in Μ

them: in that which is on the right hand Ι saw this
inscription.
Qri fluminis vim passus
annos plures jacuerat,
Civitatis ornamento,

Pons tandem est restitutus.
