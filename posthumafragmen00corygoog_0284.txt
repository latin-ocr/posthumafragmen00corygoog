OBSERVATIONS OF WORMS

ricke of Wormes was from thenceforth converted toa
Rishopricke, one Wernharius that immediately succosded
the foresaid Guerilio‚ being chosen the first Bishop thereos
in the time of Carolus Magnus. From which time the
Citie of Wormes hath bene ever graced with a Bishop bya
continuall and orderly succession of them till this present
Bishop Gulielmus, whom 1 have before mentioned.

Thus much of the Archbishopricke and Bishop
of Wormes.

He Praetorium or Senate house of the Citie that merem
adjoineth to the market place is a very sumptuous ΗΜ·
building, the front whereof is beautified with many faire
pictures. But the fairest of allisos Fridericke the third
of that name Emperour, who is very gloriously painted [p. 533·]
in gold, sitting in his throne with his Imperial} crowne
upon his head, and his Scepter in his hand, and under him

this is written.

Fridericus 3. Imper. Aug.
1 .
Under that this. 593

Renovata est haec basilion 1592.

phgaine under that Ι read this distich written in golden
etters. ·

Astra Deo nil majus habent, nil Caesare terra,
Si terram Caesar, si regit astra Deus.

Also under that I read this inscription in a long line, above
the which two souldiers were painted in their armour,
leaning downe a little. And at one end of the front another
souldier in his complete armour, displaying an ancient,
and at the other end is painted a Qeene with a crowne
upon her head. This inscription (I say) did 1 reade there
in that long line.

Libertatem uam majores peperere digne studeat fovere
posteritas. urpe enim esset parta non posse tueri.
