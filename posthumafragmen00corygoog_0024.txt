In both sides of this walke Ι saw Cedat trees, Orange, Fun trees.
Lemmon, and Pome-citron trees, and fruits of all these
kiudes ripe. Amongst the rest Ι observed passing faire
Citrons, which made my mouth even water upon them,
and caused me almost to transgresso his law. One side of
the walke is invitoned with a goodly wall, hp the which
the fruits doe grow. About the middle o the walke
there is built a prety convenient house, wherein tame
connies and divers sorts of fine birds are kept, as Turtles,

roofe, supported with eight stately pillars of white stone,

And many lofty Pinc trees, but some of them were so ΒΜ·

the quantity that ever I saw.
The fourth and last memorable thing of this City is a The rheam

stately nire Theater, which was built by certaine Scholars africana.
