CORYAT'S CRUDITIES

Martinus
Scaliger.

Upon the toppe of all, even upon a little pinnacle
standeth the statue of Mastinus Scaliger himselfe on
horsebacke made of alabaster. It dotb very neate
represent the living shape of him. For it is said
that it was made in his lie time. In the lower part of
the monument this Epitaph is written.

SCaligera de gente fui, celebrique ferebar
Nomine Mastinus, claras dominabar in urbes.
Me Dominum Verona suum, me Brixia vidit,
Parmaque cum Luca, cum Feltro Marchia tota.
Jura dabam populis ω uo libramine nostris
Omnibus, δι fidei, ἃ C isti, sine sorde secutor.
Occubui primb post annos mille trecentos

Et decies quinque, heu, lux ibat tertia juni.

The other monument is of Canis Grandis, or Magnus

also is this Epitaph.
SI Canis hic grandis ingentia facta peregit,
Marchia testis adest quam saevo Marte subegit,
Scaligeram qui laude domum super astra tulisset,
Majores si Parca dies infida tulisset:
Hunc Julii geminata dies undena peremit,
Jam lapsis septem quater annis mille trecentis.

Magnus, as Pipin his sonne, Prince Berengarius and
