CORYAT’S CRUDITIES

The other two have like most valiant champions of Christ,
especially Ursinus, fought the Lords battell against the
enemies of Gods true religion, partly with their eloquent
to es, and partly with their elegant quilles. The one
of t em, Ι meane that holy Ursinus, having besides many

other most learned nacts of divinity, written so incompas-
ably learned a Catechisme, and so profitable unto Gods

Church, that 1 thinke there was never any booke of the
like subject since the time of the Apostles worthy to be
paralleled with it; the other, besides many excellent
theolo icall tracts that he hath written, hath most manfully
defenfed the old and ancient Christianisme against the new
and counterfaited Jesuitisme. Here also lived Paulus
Melissus that excellent Poet and worthy Knight Palatine.
Here Bartholomew Kicherman that notable artist professed
Logicke and Philosophy. Here finally flourished those
foure famous men at that time that I was in Heidelberg,
David Pareus publike professor of Divinity, Dionysius
Gothofredus an excellent civill Lawyer, Doctor Lingel·
semius and Janus Gruterus whom I have before mentioned,
such as greatly gratified me in the citie. All these from
the first to the last have bene so excellent and learned
writers that the have otten themselves such a celebrity
of name, as will never be extinguished while the fabricke

of the world do last.
Thus much of Heidelberg.

[p. ςοι.] Ι Departed from Heidelberg the eight day of September
being Thursday about nine of the clocke in the morn-

ing, an came to the City of Spira which is twelve miles
beyond it, about five of the clock in the afternoone.

A dmm· Eetwixt these two Cities Ι passed through a great wood,
which by reason of the manifold turnings and windings of
the way like a company of voluminous Meanders, did so
exceedingl perplexe me, that I got out of the same with
no small difficulty. About three miles before I came to
Spira I was ferried over the Rhene in a boate.
