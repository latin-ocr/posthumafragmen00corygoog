jelousie is odious in this place. But let these Germanes
and Helvetians do as they list, and observe these kind of
wanton customes as long as they will; for mine owne
part were 1 a married man, and meant to spend some little
time here with my wife for solace and recreation sake,

they are of very soveraigne vertue for the curing of

these infirmities, viz. the tertian and quartan agne, the

itch‚ the cholicke and the stone3 and it hath one most

rare vertue that Ι never heard of any barhes in all the
