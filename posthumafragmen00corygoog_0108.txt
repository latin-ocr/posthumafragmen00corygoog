OBSERVATI-ONS OF CHUR

written by that learned Josias Simlerus of Zurich in
Switzerland‚ who (as a learned man told me in Curia) hath
gritten a peruliar Treatise of the common-weale of the

nsons.

In this City there is a mint where they stampe money A mintin
of gold, silver‚ and tin that serveth for the whole territory. ων·
Tlus mint Ι saw together with their armoury house, but
Ι had not the opportunity to enter into either of them.

Here was Ma nentius (whom Ι have before mentioned
in my notes of Lyons) proclaimed Emperour by his
Souldiers against Constante the second sonne of Constan-
tine the Great‚ at what time the same Magnentius was
general] Captayne of the Roman legions in Rhetia‚ and
afterward he slew the same Emperour Constance as he
slept in his bed in a towne called Helena not farre from
the Pyrenean mountaines.

In the principall market place which is opposite to St. Theprincipa
Martius Church before mentioned, there is a goodly faire mmm·
conduit with a faire statue of an armed man standin

I was in the City in repayring th1sconduit‚ so that they [p. 37¹·]
have greatly beautified rt.

Ι read these verses following written upon a rich citizens
house of this City, even upon the outside of the wall over
the dore.

Deus.

Stant dextris laevaque undae, procede Viator
transi, rumpe moras, anteriora vide.
Viator.
Duc me, nec sine me, per me Deus optime, duci,
nam duce me pereo, te duce salvus ero.

Thus much of Curia.

Departed from Curia about sixe of the clocke in the
morning the foure and twentieth of August being

Wednesday, and came to Walastat a towne of the country
of Helvetia, now called Switzerland, foure Helvetian Helveria.
