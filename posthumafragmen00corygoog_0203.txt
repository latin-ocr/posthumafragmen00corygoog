CORYAT'S CRUDITIES

the exquisitest peece of work for a Tower that ever I saw,
as wel for the height, as for the rare curiosity of the
architecture3 so that neither France, Italy, nor any City
in Switzerland or vast Germany, nor of any Province or
island whatsoever within the precincts of the Christian
world can shew the like. It was be nin the yeare 1277.
at what time Rodolph Earle of abspurg was Emper-
our of Germany, and was continually buildin for the
space of ei ht and twenty yeares together, tiil it was

iuli perfectiori. The principall Architect was
one lirvinus of Steinbach (as the Author of those excellent
Hexameter verses which Ι have prefixed before this
description of Strasbourg doth testifie) who contrived the
whole modell of the worke himselfe, and was the chiefe
Mason in the performing of this peerelesse Machine, which
he raised from the very foundation to the toppe with
square stones most artificially and rarely cut. The staires
that leade u to the tower‚ are made windingly, being
distinguished with foure severall degrees, and where the
thicknesse doth begin to be acuminated in a slender toppe,
there are ei ht degrees more of those winding staires that
rise above the first foure. The ball which standeth upon
the highest toppe of all, seemeth to those that are heneath

in stone that are erected round about the compasse of the
Tower, are things of such singular beautie, that they are
very admirable to behold, and such as will by reason of the
rare novelty of the worke, drive a stranger that is but a

Aunoosue novice incoavery extasie of admiration. Also the altitude

mr.

of it is so strange, that from the bottome to the toppe it is

, saide to containe five hundred seventy foure Geometrical

foote3 which much exceedeth the famous Italian Towers‚
as that of Cremona, which is esteemed the loftiest of all
Italy, Saint Markes of Venice, which although it be but

two hundred eightie foote high, yet the Venetians doe
