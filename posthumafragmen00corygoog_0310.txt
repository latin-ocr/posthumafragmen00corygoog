OBSERVATIONS OF FRANKFORT

tlffillthtlhttl‘ hlilililhlill‘hiilssli‘}
Ι observed a very fat soile, and two sumptuous palates. ΜΝ
Whereof one that l saw on the right hand, situate alone dm·
by it selfe in a very spacious and pleasant meedow, was the
most Princely and royall building that Ι saw in Germany,
saving the Pfaltzgraves of Rhene in the citie of Heidel-
berg. For this was a seat well beseemin an Emperours
Court; and the situation so sweet and delectable that it
seemed to me to stand in a second garden of Eden. This
one place doth sufficiently confirmo the truth of Kirchners
elegant agnomination in his Oration of the praise of
Germany, that the Moene will yeeld as great amenity as
the Po of Italy, or any other lorraine river. The name

of the place is Kelsterbach. Heretofore the Landgrave of Kelsterback·
Hassia was Lord of it. But 1 understood that he hath sold

it within these few yeares to a certaine Germane Prince.

The other Palace stood in a certaine towne on the left

hand of the Moenus about foure miles on this side Franck-

ford, and helon hto the Arthbisho of Mentz; but

that is much ineriour to this. Alit eon this side the ,
townes end of Franchford ,Ι observed a most rufull Amsalssgn

My Observations of Franchford. [P- 5⁶¹·]

Julius Coesar Scaliger hath written these verses upon
Franchford.

Ulta laboratis debet anckfordia sulcis: &otgers
Multa racemiferis vinea culta jugis. '‘m‘' ⁰¹¹
Qtid referam, uanta dt quoe convexere metalla? ΜΨ·
Quae Mars be ipotens, quae petit alma Ceres?
Huc Italus patriis miratur partibus orbem,
Advectum huc stupuit Gallica magna suum.
