Bagam. and came to Ber omum commonly called Bergomo the
last City of the henetian Signiory about seven of the

clocke in the evening. The distance betwixt these two

Cities is thirty miles. Ι observed in this space t
abundance of goodly vineyards‚ which at thatotime y ι ed

without leave, to refresh my sele with some of their

grapes. Which the Italians like very good fellowes did

vinke at, shewing themselves more ltinde unto me then

the Germans did afterward in Germany‚ as Ι will hereafter

declaro in my observations of their country. For they

vill not graunt a stranger that liberty to oe into any of

their vineyardes without leave, as the I ans doe. The

one spacious lane, on both sides whereof the goodly vine-

yardes grew, extending it selfe about eighteene miles in

ength. All that day I saw great abundance of people

of the horsemen beihrg well appointed· with musltets or
pewternels ready charged, according to that custome of
the Italians that I have before mentioned.
