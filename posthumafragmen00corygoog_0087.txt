CORYAT'S CRUDITIES

country which speaketh Dutch, Ι wil here interrupt my
[12364] description of it by the addition of a most elegant Latin
Oration that Ι have annexed unto this discourse written

in praise of the travell of Germany by that learned German
Hermannus Kirchnerus‚ the author of the first Oration
that l have prefixed before my booke, and according to

my meane skill rudely translated into our mother tongue

by my selle: which although perhaps it may seeme unto

ι some a meere impertinent matter to my resent discourse:
a: yet in regard that Rhetia is a member olPGermanie, whose
c ⁸ daigisirietliatgrdiiivhigthgrl iheshhlhetthisahcirblhychiihtlrtyuhi
Italy, after my survay of some parts theros ; Ι hope the
candid reader wil not miscensure me for inserting this
into my Observations, especiall seeing the elegancy of it

is such, that it cannot be but pleasant to all readers what-
soever, but more particularly unto travellers, δι most of

all unto those that either have already seene some parts

of Germany, or intend hereafter to see it. As Ι for mine

of the Almighty to see most of the famous Cities and
reatest Princes Courts both of all the higher parts of
{ermany δι the Netherlands, which are places that toan
industrious traveller will yeeld infinite both experience and
deli ht. To detayne thee long with preambles of praises

of titis most imperial] and renowned Region out of my
little experiente of the same, were a matter very super-
fluous, seeing this most elopuent Oration doth as lively

int her out in her true co ours as ever Apelles did his
gamus ἆναδυομένη. Onely the better to encourage thee

to see her lorious beauty, whereof l my selfe have to my
unspeakable joy and comfort perceived a little glimpse, l

say with Kirchnerus‚ that German is the Qeene of all
other Provinces‚ the Eagle of allKingdomes, and the
Mother of all Nations. Therefore omitting farther intro·
ductions l present unto thy entle and favourable censure

this excellent Oration it e.
