OBSERVATIONS OF RHETIA

Italy, and England.

Tbe Windovves of their houses are exceeding little in
all their Terraes and in most of their townes‚ the greatest
part whereof are covered with little boordes in the outside.

In sundry places of their country 1 observed divers l} 3⁶3·]
Castles and Forts of eat antiquity built upon high Mfflff'
rockes, and eminent ils. But now they are much '

built either by the lilibawers of King Rhetus that inhabitod
this Country after he was ejected out of his Kingdome of
Hetruria in Italy by Bellovesus the Gaule (as l have before ’

certaine wooden instruments made for the same p se
that do very easily sever the stranne from the scale. urThpoeir
