University‚ Et so finally end this discourse of Heidelberg.
Here lived joannes Dalbu-rgius wunseller tu Ludovicus
Count Pnlatine of Rhene, and afim-ward Bishop of
Worrnes, a mun of si learning. Here also pro-
femed thzt ndnflnble He ricinn Conrzdus Pellimnus, who
read the Hebrew lecture3 and Sebastian Munstet his
successor in the earne lecture which he rad there five years,
as he himselfe doth write. Likewise he wrote some part
of his Oosmographie in this Universitie, as Mr. Gruterus
told me: here joannes Virdunguff that notpble Mathema-
Zfflni’iss'f‘fflnssss 333²?ssss ssfflffffiistzss
Augusta, and fzmoused over ²11 Christendome for his
exoellent learning, especially in the studie of humanitie,
read philosophie and Astrologie for the u of many
yares; und nlso did nt lut shut up his vinfffiiies in this
citie. Here that Phoenix and mitade of her uexe Olympia
Fulvia Monta nn Italian Gentlewornm borne, spent a good
part of her time in sacred meditations, and most sweete
exereises of learning, after she had abandoned the vanities
of the Duke of Fexnrzes Coutt in Italy, and the po ish
religion; who by her incessant study profited so m '

the Greeke and Latine tongues, that she luth immortalized
her fame by her most elegunt writin s, and added some

after he had before bene a professor in the two Ηηξξνὲτείῐίιε
of Jene and Lei zicke. Here joannes Willingus a

divines, three shining lem of Christe Church, Emanuel

of Venice3 Zachuius Ursinus, and Petrus uinus read
