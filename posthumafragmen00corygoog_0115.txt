CORYAT'S chDITIEs

of St. Denis in ance, aa 1 have before mentioned, that
they carried their hade in their hands efter they were
strooken off from their bodies, to the place where they
desired to be buried. How true or fflse this is, Ι will not
disput: the mutter, because I never read the Histoi-ie in
any authentjcke writer, onely I hard it of the learned
men of the eicie. In the Cloyster of this foreasid Church

Theodorus Bibliander, Com-³55⁵ Gesnerus, Ludovicus

a flat stone laide upon them without E oph, or any maner
of inscription to preserve them from n livium in so much

except one of the Citie shew him the particula-s. Surely
the memorie of these worthy men would quickly be
extinguished unong the z'ssgurines, if they had not in
their life time immortzli the same by their lem-ned

beautified by Carolus Magnus, who upon the yense 810
bestowed great charges upon the same. For n monument

ι goodly stonie sume to the honour of his name in the
