CORYAT’S CRUDITIES Α

ariis dotibus absolutius: absit invidia dicto. Nulla erat
honesta disciplina, in qud vir ille non poterat cum summis
artificibus contendere. Inter Graecos Gracissimus, inter
Latinos Latinissimus. In carmine Maronem alterum
dixisses: In oratione Politianum quendam lepore referebat,
majestate superabat. Oratio vel extemporalis adeh pura,
aded Germana, ut non Frisium quempiam, sed urbis
Romane vernaculum loqui contenderes. El uentiae tam
absolutae parem adjunxerat eruditionem. ollitosophiae
mysteria omnia penetraverat. Nulla pars musices quam
non exactissime calleret. Extremo vitre tempore ad literas
Hebraioas acScripturam divinam totum animum appulerat.

J ’⁸ Epitalph written upon the said Agricola hy that famous
‘ · and earned Venetran Gentleman Hermolaus Barbarus

[r- 499·]

Patriarch of Aquileia; which Epitaph (as it is extant upon
the monument of him in one of the lesser Churches of
Heidelberg) was communicated unto me by a learned
Gentleman of the Universitie, (and mentioned also hy
Erasmus himselfe in the same ada e whence Ι have derived
the premisses) who told me that Agricola was buried there
Anno 1485 in the habite of a Franciscan Frier, according
as Ι have sometimes observed secular men buried in

Italy.

The Epitaph is this.

Invida clauserunt hoc mmmore fata Rodolphum
Agricolam, Frisii spemque decusque soli:

Scilicet hoc uno meruit Germania laudis
Qudquid habet Latium, Gracia quicquid habet.
