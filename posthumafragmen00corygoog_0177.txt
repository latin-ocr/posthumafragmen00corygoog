At the East end of the Church are two faire Cloisters,
wherein Ι observed a little common-weale of worthy

monuments, whereof some are nuncient and some new.
Certainly 1 never saw so many epitaphs together in one
Church in nll my life. For most of those that have beene
erected of late yeares, being inserted into the walles of the
Cloyster round about, are beautified both with elegant

epitaphs, and with prety little turned pillnrs of marble,
or other faire kinde of stones, garnished with gilt scutchins,
armes, and such like curious workes. In one of these
Cloysters 1 saw these three epitaphs together, side by side,
in one nnd the selfe same row, written in certaine con-
venient stones upon the wall, and under the same as many
severall flat tomb-stones, under which the bodies of those
famous men are interred that are nominated in the same

epitaphs: The first of them was this.

Dum Jacobum Meierum
hujus inclytae urbis
Consulem prudentis-
simum, consultissimum-
que, pietatis sanae
cultorem, ac promo-
torem primarium,
omnis honestatis,
quod in ipso fuit
instauratorem dili-
gentissimum, lapis
sub'ectus contegit.
