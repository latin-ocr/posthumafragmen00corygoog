That which is omitted about the yeare of his death, l
will add my selfe. He dyed Anno 1539. In one partos
the other Cloyster Ι saw these two epitaphs something
neate together, the one of that famous man Pantaleon
written in olden letters in a faire stone, inserted into the
wall direc y over his tombe.

*Here he hath not expretsed the yeare of his death, which was 1531.
shortly after Zuinglins was alaine in Switzerland.

c.c.u. 161 ι.
