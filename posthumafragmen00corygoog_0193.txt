CORYAT'S CRUDITIES

September being Thursday, and came to the Citie of
Strasbourg, which is foure scote English miles beyond it,
about eleven of the clocke the next morning being Friday,
and the second day of September. By the way 1
by two Cities‚ both seated on the right hand of the e,
whereof the one is called Neobourg, the other Brisae
, Both these are Papistical. The Thursday night it was my
chaunce to lie about twenty miles on this si e Strasbourg
in my boate sub dio upon a wadde of straw, having for
my coverled the cold open aire which did not a little punish
me: yet 1 comforted my selfe with the recordation of the

old verse,

Dulcia non meruit qui non gustavit amara,
that I did not deserve tbe sweet junkats of my little
experience without some bitter pillea and hard brunts of

Germany, w ich it disterminateth from France, deriveth
his origlinal sprin from a certaine Mountaine of the

Rhetica Alpes ed Adula but a little way distant from

the Citie of Curia above mentioned, which yeeldeth two

the Rhodanus that Ι have above spoken of in my descrip-
tion of Lyons‚ there is interjected no longer space then of
three houres journey, the high Mountaine Godard (which
is commonly esteemed the hi hest of all the Al ine Moun-
taines) deviding them asuntier. Virgil calle this river

bicornis: as
