OBSERVATIONS OF BRESCIA

My Observations of Brixia.

Julius Cesar Scaliger hatthritten this Hexastichon upon
rma.

Uae pingues scatebras speculi despectat ab atta &stads
‚Postulat imperii Brixia magna vrces. {2252ss
Coelum hilarum, frons laeta urbi, gens nescia fraudis. '

Tunc poterat Dominis ipsa jubere suis.

This citie stondeth in that part of Lombardy which is
called Longobardia Transpadana, because it is beyond the
river Po, and is sittute in a plaine at the foote of a hill,
being in compasse three miles. It was first founded by Brutia
the nuncient Gaules called Cenomani, though some doe small&
write it was a Colony of the Romans. Ι heard that there ‘² '
are some notable antiquities and inseri tions in this citie, [p. 334]
but I must intrent thee (gentle R er) to pardon me

although 1 doe not communicate them to thee. For 1

made so short aboad in the Citie, that Ι could not observe
halfe so much as Ι would have done if 1 bad remained
there but one whole day.

five gates, and fortilied with a most im regnable Castle
that standeth upon a hill, built all with tice-stone. Also
it is well watered with pleasant springs and sweete foun-
