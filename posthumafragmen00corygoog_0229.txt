CORYAT'S CRUDITIES

Mr. Janus Gruterus the Princes Bibliothecarie‚ of whom

1 have reason to make a kind and thanlcebtl mention,
because I received great hvours of him in Heidelberg.

For he entertained me very courteously in his house,
shewed me the Librarie, and made meanes for my admis-

sion into the Princes Court. Well hath this man deserved

of the common-weale of good letters, beoeuse he hath

much benefited and illustrated it by his elegant workes‚

as his Animadversions upon all the workes of Seneca the
Philosopher‚ and his Fax artium, which though it be

[μ 473] nothing but the compiling together of other mens workes‚
yet the singular industrie that he hath shewed in it together

with his fine methode‚ doth deserve no small praise. A

Christendomei³ especially of Justus Lgibsiun betwixt whom

divers elegant Epistles have passed that are published to

the world. 1 observed him to be a very sweet and
eloquent discourser. For he speaketh a most elegant and

true Ciceronian phrase which is graced with a facill&
expedite deliverie. In so much that Ι dare parallell him

in a manner for the excellency of his Latin tongue with

Mr. Grynaeus of Basil whom Ι have before so much
extolled. But Ι will cease to praise my friend Mr.
Gruterus, because his owne worth doth more truly com-

mend him then Ι shall ever be able to doe with my
inelegent stile, and so Ι will returne to that famous Pala·

tine ibrarie. It is built over the roofe of the body of

the Church. A place most beautifulh and divided into

two very large and stately roomes that are singular well
furnished with store of bookes of all faculties. Here are

rnen· so many auncient manuscripts, especially of the Greeke
manuscr ⁸ · and Latin Fathers of the Church‚ as no Librarie of all
Christendome‚ no not the Vatican of Rome nor Cardinall
Bessarions of Venice can compare with it. Besides there
