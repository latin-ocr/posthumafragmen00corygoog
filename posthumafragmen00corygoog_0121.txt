of proofe, and crested helmets upon their heads, which a
stranger· at the first entrance of the roome would conjecture

to be hving, and very naturall men standing in their
armour3 this also giveth no small grace to eroome.
In another roome I saw most terrible swords made accord-
ing to the ‘imitation oi ΙΙιοεῗύῖΙιειϊΕ the angient legpitiaepis
{ttllthgitltzttfftlttl ,wtythn‘gtthg fin}
steelen pranges, or sharpe hookes at the sides. In another
roome I saw onely speares and launces, whereof there was

a goodly company. Againe in another, axes and mattocks

. for pioners to use about digging of trenches. In the lowest

roome of all, which is the fourth, Ι noted an exoeeding

¹ ⁰ multitude of pieces of ordinance of all sorts, as culverius,
Μ · demiculverins, demicannons, socors, basiliskes, &c whereof

some were taken as trophies from the foresaid Duke of
' Burgundy, being indeed pieces of admirable beauty and
value, adorned with his armes, and many curious borders
and works contrived in the same. Amongst the rest Ι
saw one passing great murdering piece, both the ends
thereof were so exceeding wide, that a very corpulent man
llhhltlhintllsttt iliisswrwsshwbiiiilihfi
and very sumptuous brasen pieces eqdalling at the least,gif
not exceeding the length of the longest piece Ι saw in the
Citadell of Milan, above named. All these things l saw

kept very daintily, and in passing good order. Although

Μ’ this armoury be well able to arme ten thousand men, yet

· if there should happen any occasion of warres, they neede
not use any of it: because every private man of the citie,
together with the rest in the other townes, villages, and
hamlets of the country are privately very well furnished in
their owne houses: onely if they hire any suangers then
they use it, but not else. The Tigurines are able to
furnish fortie thousand armed men in their whole terri-
tory; but the Citie it selfe armeth two thousand onely
and no more.

Thus much of the Armoury.
