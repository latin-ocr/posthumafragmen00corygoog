OBSERVATIONS OF BINGEN

tract betwixt Busil and Colen. Nemely sunbour , Spin,
Wormes, Meutz, Bing, Boppard„ Cnffluenoe, ιιι Bonan.
But on the other side 1 saw no eity or Towne of any [p. ⁵69]
note, but only Brisac a little from Buil, ud yet that m
but ι meme thing in compnrison ns some of these. The
like whereof I hflve hard is to be observed in one of the
baukes of the Danubius betwixt the place of the rising
thereof md Hun 'e. In which bnnke there are many
sutely Cities hm r, as Putavit, Ratishum, and divers
others. But on the opposite banke there are no ancient
Cities οι· Cirndels to be seene. The reason is, beuuse the
Romans durst not mise any un thzt side for feu-e of the
sudden invasion of the Germane that dwelt neore at huid.

1 obser-ved many custome Tuwnes betwixt Mentz and Cum ιιηιι,
Colen, which are in number eleven. The belong to
divers Prinoes Spirituall and Tempomll, who receive a
great yearlie revenue by them. All passer-lgm whateoever
they are, noble or ⁴ oble, must arrive in ench of these

laces, and stay a wh: e till the boatemen hath paid mmome
his passage. To the pnssenger it is no charge st all,
but only tu the master of the bone. If my should dure
in n resolute and wilfull humour to passe by any of these
Ψ and not pay the stinted summe of money, the
blimns that sit nt the receipt of eunome, will reseutly
disclm (as Ι heard) a peeee of Ordimme at tll'em, and
make ern an example to au after—commen. Richnrd nne
of our English Kings did once very gndously abolish nu
these tolles und taxatione by mter, to the great benefit
of the Genusus and al other passengers, when he kept his
Court in the City uf Worme5‚ after he was elected King
of the Romans by the Elector Prima, aa Ι have before
mentioned in my Observutions of that City. Which thing
d him the gre-t love md good will of the people

that little time that he lived in Germanic.

The first of these townes where we arrived m: Eing, ΠΨ,
iselphoe of great antiquitie. in Latine Bingium, that

onflffieth to the Archbishop of Mena, and professeth the

religion. At this towne there is ι river mlled Nalm [p. ⁵72]
