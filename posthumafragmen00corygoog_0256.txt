OBSERVATIONS OF SPIRES

endes with battlements, which are by little and little
acuminated till they rise to a sharpe toppe‚ doth especially
adorne their buildings. Which fashion Ι observed in
Heidelberg also, and in most Cities both of higher and

lower Germanic.
The Churches of the City are in number sixteene (ΜΝ

whereof foure are Collegiat‚ foure that are called Parish ⁸P'm·

Churches, foure of Mendicant Friers, throe of Nunnes‚
and one of Jesuits. Their Cathedrall Church is dedieated
to our Lady, (which our eloquent but A state country-
man Robert Turner in a Tract inti ed Triumphus
Bavaricus, affirmeth to beas great a grace to this City
as a white tooth to an AEthiopian) a very nificent
structure that yeeldeth a most gorgeous shewnihne off

by reason of the foure lofty turrets built at the corners

thereos, which to those that come towards the City do

resent a prety kinde of forme not unlike to a cradle.

finis Church was founded about the yeare 1030. by the
Emperour conrade the second surnamed Salicus. Who

upon the twelfth day of Julie the same yeare placed the

first fundamental] stone with his owne handes. But by

reason that God called him out of the world before he

could accomplish his worke, he injoyned his sonne Henry

the third in his death-hedde, who succeeded him in the [p. 504]
Empire‚ to finish the building that he beganne‚ which was
accordingly performed by his said sonne.

I observed more monuments of Emperors and royall May Μ’]
Persons buried in the Quire of this Church then in any mm.
other whatsoever in my whole voyage. For here lie the
bodies of eight German Emperors and two Empresses,
besides many other worthy wights of both sexes. The
Emperors I will reckon by dsggrees in order as they reigned.

The first was Conradus icus the sixteenth German
Emperor, and the first of the imperiall familie of Fran·
conia, who was founder of the Church as l have already
said. Here was he buried after he had reigned fifteene
yeares, his body being translated hither from the City of
Utricht in the Netherlands, where he died in the yeare
