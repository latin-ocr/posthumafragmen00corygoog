CORYAT’S CRUDITIES

in the yeare M.D.lxxxiiii. that ‘were called Academici
Olympici, but why so called Ι know not. It bath an
Orchestra made in it according to the imitation of tbe
Roman Orchestraes, which is at the lower end of the
degrees, or (as I may more roperly terme them) benches

or seates, whereof there are hrurteene, each above another,

compassing somethin more then halfe the Theater‚ and
contrived in the fashion of an halfe Moone. In that
Orchestra none sit but Noble and eminent persons. He
that shewed me this Theater told me that the Orchestra
and fourteen benches would containe about some three

· thousand persons. The Scene also is a very faire and

beautiful] place to behold. In this Theater was acted a
la for many yeares since with divers goodly shewes
Μαι William Gonzaga Duke of Mantua, father to the
present Duke Vincentrus Gonzaga. Againe, afterward

‘ certaine Moscovite Ambassadors that came from Rome,

were very honourably entertained in this Theater with
musicke and a ban uet. And after them certaine yougg

W Noblemen of that eremote region in the East call

Japan or Japona, being descended of the bloud royall of

the Country, were received here with great state, at what
time Livius Pajellus a sin ular Orator pronounced an

eloquent Oration rn praise οῗ them. But one of the latest

Inan'prior in

tle rheam.

t shewes that was made here was presented before the
orenamed that famous Earle Leonardus Walmarana, in
the yeare 1585. For at that time the Tragedy of
Sophocles, which is intituled Oedipus, was most excellently
acted in this Theater. The history of the acting whereof
is finely painted in the Court wal at the very entrance to
the Theater. Over the three dores of which Court I read
these three inscriptions, written in Capitall letters.

This over the first.
Olympicis Excitamento.
This over the second.
Civibus Oblectamento.
And this over the third.
Patriae ornamento
