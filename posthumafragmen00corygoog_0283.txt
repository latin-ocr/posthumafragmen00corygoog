CORYAT'S CRUDITIES

to have beene newly written. l had a great desire to
write them out. But the time would not give me leave.
For that day that l wrote these Sibylline prophecies, l spent
but sixe hours in wormes, by reason that a certain urgent
occasion called me away from the City even about noone,
ψ which derived meos the opportunity to write those
