Cornelius Tacitus, dun sumone Historiographer

me over the river ιι the entrance of the It

eth in that past of Switzerland which* ιιι tycalled
Ergovin, and on the fau-ther side of the river there lyeth
the terri of Tutgovin. On one side of the towne ate
oet-nine ' es, and on the other the river Limatus :fou-e·
..id tlut maneth by Zurich, on which river they due
munlly passe in bonta betwixt Zurieh and this City.

' e, the City is so built that it anadeth ou both sida

Helvetia, which xe the reason that the confederata doe
oelebnte ull thais publ-ique assemblies that oenoerne the
whole unte in this City. There anadeth a Castell upon
the nappe of the hill which duth now suffer great diiap nda-
timu. One thing I observed' ιιι the German Citiesp that
