On the same hand ascendeth a very faire architectoniml
Machine made of wainscot with t curiosity, the sides
being adorned with pretty little pfileoers of marble of divers
. colours‚ in which are three degrees, wheroof each con-
aasz?hiriensisnavarris 1325
. . name is written in golden letters, and by the sides these
two words in the like golden letters, Arithmetica ἃ
Geometria. The second the picture of a certain Ki
with a regall Scepter in his hand. But what King it isal
know not. Above him is written Daniel 2. Ca . The
last is the picture of Nicolaus Copernicus t rare
Astronomer, under whom this is written in faire Roman
letters: Nicolai Copernici vera effigies ex ipsius autographo
depicta. At the very toppe of this rowe or series of
worke is erected a most excellent effigies of a Cocke which
doth passing curiously represent the living shape of that
¹ emerseir vocal creature, and it croweth at certaine houres, yeeldin
k ‘W- as shrill and loud a voice as a naturall Cocke, yon and suth
a kinde of sound (which maketh it the more admirable)
as counterfeyteth very neere the nuc voyce of that bird.
The houres are eleven of the clocke in the morning, and
three in the asternoone. It was my chance to heare him
at the third houre in the asternoone, whereat I wondered
as much as I should have done if Ι had seene that famous
wooden Pigeon of Architus Tarentinus the Philosopher
(so much celebrated by the ancient Historians) flie in the
ayre. On the right hand also of this goodly architecture
there is another row of buildin correspondent to the fore·
said in heigth‚ but differing hom it in forme. For the

principall part thereof consisteth of a paire of windin

staires made of free stone, and most delicately composerl

I could not perceive for what use they serve, so that Ι

conjecture they are made especially for ornament. Againe
