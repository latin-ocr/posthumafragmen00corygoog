GEORGE CORYAT‘S POEMS

The oodly spoiles‚ the triumphes got ofcivill foe by fight ?
The esterne tumults how he quencht‚ to shew here do I
And hoheatshose furious rebels were by his force brought
A deedtwssrhhcpraise a pahne not wonne without expence
The Dggghhogurtesie shineth yet, the ground did feele
He casthhrilhgffidere in compasse wise, and folding wreathes
With ςτῗῇγᾚξίἴὲε his lofty wings amongst those ghests he
For thesslealgploits done in the West, tis knowne every
Both Baygyrg} §ardiffe was he made, δι County of Pem-
Ο mffiksasp'lrffing Edward dies, his fatall time is come,
And Mary doth possesse the Crowne, his sister hath his
And nohozffeew by Wyats fetch‚ there gius a civil] broyle,
Against the Queene he doth conspire with all his force and
He leagptygeyorth his rebell route, even unto London wall,
The Queene doth make chiese of this warre, & Captaine
The Drgaegthehalgreen. What should she do? what other
hope remaind?

He spits his venim round about, wherewith her foes are
Thmughthlhhhhest of the enemies rout, without feare doth
The tralyetgr‘s’ tremble, he them o’errunnes‚ and taketh
An οἶῗιῖοζᾚέιῐὲὓε yet he fought under Queene Maries

’ S. Quinhffi’walles his soldiers shakt, and got the gole

and game.
