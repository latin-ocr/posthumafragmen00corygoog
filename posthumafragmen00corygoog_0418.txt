GEORGE CORYAT'S POEMS
One thing my [ord there restcth yet, which I do boldly

That faillllse'lore thy lcsson be, t’obey the Lyon brave.
And as the Sire pleasdc the old, and all the Lyons secde,
By his example be thou prest therein elce to proceede.
Do as you do, prostrate before the Lyon lay you downe.
The Lyon, or the Lyonesse, which now doth beare the
Was ενξττζὲιῗέιηά most propense unto the Dragonprcene,
As Kiny2 her father was his friend, so hoe his riendly
Whosc olldleynepift did him preferre to beare so high a
[ordpSllretvlard of her house, chicfc guidc δι guerdon of her
She cancellrlllrttthc Dragons impe, before the Dragon old,
And will I trust God graunt her life, long reigne over us
God gratdthflllchmbrokc Dragon may likewise live many
That heznlgrlbme the Lyon well both for to love and
eare.

Your honours most humble Chaplayne,

George Coryate.

Ad illustrissimum Comitem Oxoniensem.

CLare Comes, generis summum decoramen aviti,
Insuper Angliaci magna Columna soli.

Da veniam tenui modulanti carmina plectro,

Quod nequit optatis verba referre sonis.

Te tua nobilitas commendat bc inclyta virtus,
Fortiaque eximii corporis acta tui.

Nil opis externae quaeris, nec carmina (quamvis
Carmen amet quisquis carmine digna gerit)

Huc tamen adveniens cum Principe nobilis hospes,
Carminibus nobis excipiendus eris.
