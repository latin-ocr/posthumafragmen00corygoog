OBSERVATIONS OF VICENZA

confidently maintayne it, that by the prayers which godly [p 302] -
people doe make in the Church of that Monastery that
Moneth, one souie shall be redeemed out of Purgatory
forsooth. infinite are the votive tables that I saw hanged
about the walles of this Church. I saw many indeede at
the Aitar where our Lady is worshipped at the Arsenai,
and in other places of Venice, but never a uarter so many
in one place as here. 1 walked into the loyster of the
Monks, and into a high gaiiery at the toppe of the Monae-
tery, where they have a passing sweet prospect. Surely
they dwell in as convenient a place for a retired life as
any 1 saw in Italy, nay none comparahle to it. They say
that many miracles are shewed in this Monastery.

The other memorable thing without the City, is the
sumptuous Palace of the above named Earle Odoricus
Capra, which is a little mile distant from the City. It is
built upon a prety eminent hillocke, and is round (in
which respect it is called in the Italian Rotonda) having
foure very beautiful] fronts, which doe answere the foure

parts of the world. At the East front as 1 ascended to Ti‘ffig

the house, I saw three white statues erected, and under ⁸⁰
them the picture of a blacke Goate which is his armes.

Under the which Ι read this.

Scriptum

Memoriae perpetum
Mandans haec

Dum sustinet δι abstinet.

At the West end under another scutchin this is written.

Qu aedes has arctissimo
Primogeniturae gradui
Subjecit.

At the North side this under a third scutchin.

Una cum omnibus censibus,

U tri viam magnam.
