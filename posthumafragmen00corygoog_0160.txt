THE BATHS OF BADEN

of many vomen- 'nae mter of the bathea is mingled
with great sture of brimstone md z small quantity of
alum, (ιε Mun-ter affirmeth, from whom 1 derive these
few lim sollo “ conca-ning the vertue of the bathes)
by menne· 'hx-2²} ie heuteth md dryeth up au noysome
md mld humoun. Also it is good for those infirmities
which proeeede from the cold of the head, ns the lethu-gie,
the npoplen'e, the disases of the eures und eyes. It con-
tumeth the flet-me, hesteth and dryeth up the stommh,
helped: the digestive faculty, openeth the obmuctions of
the live: und spleene, asswageth the biting and fretting of
the gnte, appeueth the paine of the members that pro-
adath from cold, md to conclude, it danseth the skmne
from spot: and freckles. But it hurteth those that have

the consumption. But old folkes, of what sexe soever
they are, rupe no benefit by these bathes. A plme that
impnneth his verme nster ι putiau mnnner rather to the
feminine then masculine kinde. And so finally 1 end
thie diacourse of the Helvetioell bathea of Hinderhuve
with that elegant Elogium ofanggius the Florentine in
ἒῖοὲᾞοηᾚῖ ἶζῖἶὲῗέἑέὲὲ ἰοῖῗῖἶῖἲὴῖἀὲῗᾈῗὲ
Thus much of the Helvetimll bathes of Hinderhove
commonly called the barhes of Bnden.
