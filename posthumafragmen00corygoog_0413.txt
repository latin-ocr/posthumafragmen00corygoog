GEORGE CORYAT’S POEMS

Whereby the Lyons Kingly minde inclined to advance
The Ἢ greene to higher state, to more triumphant

He stoutly scri’ikes him with his sword, Arise my Knight,
Besffldehghsynssm, use gilded spurres, and werre the like
And liliiveavlrisse of a noble house, with him to lead his lile,
Ο Katherine Queene‚ thy Sister Anne he doth espouse to
In natur'llsfegifter a peere to thee, in virtues rare a peere,
And Parre by name, ameeter match, Ι deeme no time did
0f her hlilreleaves three Dragons green, three imper oi
worthy ferne,
(The Lyon of the princely race, in number left the same)
Henry this Earle, and Edward eke with Lady Anne his
All whilllellg’joinde to worthy mates, whiles that he lived
And ηοξῗζζεγ live in happy state, ench one both man and
God gralrlll’them many yeares to live, and lead ajoyfull life.
The Lyon old leaveth this ayre, there is no other choyce,
And to his yong, this Dragon green, commende with
Kingly voice.
To kinges δι queenes, from time to time, thus was he
holden deare,
As by the honours he attainde, most plainly doth apperte

To Henry eight, to Edward sixth, and to Elizabeth,
The father and the children all, he was beloved till death.
For when the little Lyon carne (king Edward) to his reigne,
ln honour more the dragon grew, he had a greater traine;
Made of the noble order Knight, (a Knight so was he
twise
And after melister of the Horse: thus did this D n rise.
of trophies pight for foughten tields, what sho dl here
recite?
