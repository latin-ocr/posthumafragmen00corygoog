OBSERVATIONS 01? COLOGNE

the glory of it, und defaced mnny 300le buildings at the
same time that they mked the tuwne o Bonna, u Ι have
before written. But in steed of writing uf worthy bnttels,
1 will mention two sumnus wiffam that once lived in this
citie, who by their excellent mid discipline and re-
nowned victoria, will be eternized in Chroniclee of fame
tiu the end of the world. The one wu Ulpius Tu*
that paisant Spania-d md the fouroeenth Rom-ne Εξέ

ur, who bemg adopted by cocceius Nervn to sucoeed
m in the Επιριτε, was sent for to this citie of Colca.
where he was then Capnine or Lieutenam of ι Romane
legion. The othu- was the victorious νηπία· md glum-ioue
conquerour of the sas-noem euolus Max-mnus (of whom 1
have before made mention in my notes of S. Denis) who
after the death of his fither Pipm wu im 'soned in this
citie, being a yong man, by the meones o his nt mother
Woldsudn. But be* b the merdfilll provi enee of
God afoemrd relen ge hemme the most fortun-te
and valiant Martialist that was then in all the world.

Now were it expedient that Ι should make nome rel·-
tion uf their magistrates δι ovemment. But 1 hope
thou wilt puden me, althougffi I annot satisfie thee in
those affuires of poli . 1 would hnve thee consider that
I made my abode in alen but two daies. During whidx
spnoe 1 hope thou wilt ny l ns not idle.

Here nt the conclusion of this history of Colen Ι will
briefly mention one noe-hle thing that 1 saw in this dtie,
besides an the reat before mentioned. 11 wne my chenne
to see the icture of our sumus English Jesuiae Henry
Gaffiot, puglikely exposed to ule in a phoe of the citie,
with other things. Whnse head was ταρακτικὰ in that
minmlous figure imprinted in a utnw, as our English
Pnpim have often ed. A mutter thot I penteive is
very highly hono by divers Pnpist: beyond the sens.
Though 1 thinke the math of it is such, ὼε it may be
well mked amongst the maa-y ales of Poggius the

Florentiae.
Thus much of Colen.
