CORYAT'S CRUDITIES

full of wares and notable commodities, especiully the
Cloyster of Saint Bartholmewes Church3 where amongat
other things Ι saw a world of excellent pictures, inventione
of singular curiosity, whereof most were religious, and
such as tended to mortification. Moreover Ι sew their

Tte Exchange neere to the plaoe before mentioned mlled Under
sminge. 'Den Roemer. This is nothing like to ours in London,
the Rialto of Venice, or that which 1 saw afterward at
Middleborough in Zealand. For it is nothing but a part
of the streete, under the dilen ayre. Here 1 observeda

frequent concurse of w thy Merchants from all the

famousest regions of Christendome. Ι noted a thing in

this fayre that 1 never did before in any place. Every

[p. 5⁶⁶] man selleth his ware in his owne house, except forreners

and those that hire shoppes in the Burse. So that there

Italic and in other places) but only within the compasse

of their owne private houses. Which maketh the ayre

read that this City was once deprived of their Fayre by

the Emperour Charles the fourth, about some two hundred

and fifty yeares since, who for a oenaine grudge that he

bare to the Franckfordians by reason that they entertayned

his adversary Gunterus Earle of Schwartnenburg within

the city, and proclaimed him King of the Romanes, tooke

Ι observed no monuments of any note in this City

Thou hin St. Bartholmewes Church as a learned man tod

me ulier Ι was gone from Franckfordh 1 might have soene

the monument of the foresaid Earle Gunterus, who was

competitor with the said Charles the fourth for the Empire,

and afterward King of the Romans. For he died in this

City being poysoned by a physition, after he had reigned

sixe moneths‚ and was finally buried in the said Church.

Here also died Ludovicus surnamod Germanicus for that
