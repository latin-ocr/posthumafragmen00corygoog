CORYAT'S CRUDITIES
Architecture, Ἢ built all with square stone, and gar·

nished with g y statues, d⁰t¹¹ adde infinite

loolcing towards the cide, as the other within to-
wards the Court, doe present worlcmanship of great
state, as Ι have already said. But there is greet
difference betwixt them. For the inward front is much
more glorious and resplendent then the other. The
rincipall ornament that graceth it, is the multitude of
hire statues (which the outward Front wanteth) very
loftily advanced towards the fairest part of the court,
whereof there are foure distinct degrees or Series made
one above another. The same statues are eurved in a
sin faire milk-white stone, which seemeth as beauti-
as the fairest hlabaster, and formed in a very large

famous statuaries Polycletus and Praxiteles alive againe,
they would praise the same, and confesse they were not
able to amend them. For they imitate the true naturall
countenance and living shape of those heroicall and
Princely Foetes, whom they represent. Most of them
irs s. are the statues of the famous Palatine Princes to the last
of them Fredericke the fourth. Also Emperours‚ Kings
and Queenes are there pourtrayed. This Front is raysed
to a very great height, and decked with marveilous curious
devices at the top, all which ornaments concurrin together
doe exhibite to the eyes of the spaetator a shew most
incomparable. Truely for my owne part I was so exered-

according to the upright sinceritie of an impartiall opinion,

France‚ Italy or Germanie. Yea, I will not doubt to
derogate so much from the Fronts of the French Kings
palaces which I saw both in Paris and Fountaine Beleau3
