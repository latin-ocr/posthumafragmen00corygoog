CORYAT’S CRUDITIES

Ι lay, which was at the signe of· the golden Lyon, contained
more bathes then all these foresaid threescore of Hinder-
hove. For in the same Inne were no lesse then threescore
δι five severall Bathes, as a learned man told me that laie in
a house adjoyning to my Inne. All these barhes are
devided asunder by a great many roomes of the house,
and covered over head; the space that is limited for ench
bath being square and very narrow‚ so that in one and the
selfe same roome 1 observed foure or five distinct barhes.
All these barhes are of an equall heate, none hotter or
colder then an other. Also Ι heard that they are tnost fre·
quented in the Sommer time, contrary to our English
barhes δι those at Hinderhove‚ which are used only at the
ndns {eenrlllrhtzssf urle
alume, as Munster writeth: unto whome I am beholding
for this short ensuing discourse of the vertue of these
barhes, as I was before in the description of the bathes of
Hinderhove. Those that have tried them have found the
vertue of them to be very soveraigne for the curing of
divers diseases, as the asthma, which is an infirmity that
proceedeth from the difficulty of the breath, the moistnesse
of thee es, the crampe, the coldnesse of the stomacke, the
paine od the livcr and the s leene proceeding from cold;
also it helpeth the dropsie, [Ee griping of the bowels, the
stone, the sterility of women: lt appeaseth the paine of a
womans wombe, keepeth off the white menstruous matter,

be short, it is said to be of greater efficacie for curing of the
gowte then any other bathes whatsoever either of Germany
or any other country of Christendome.

I saw one thing in this citie that Ι did not in any other
place of Germany. For that mornin that Ι went ther·
hence, I saw a muster of a band of gallant soldiers in the
Markct place.

Thus much of Badcn in the Marquisate, commonly

called lower Baden.
