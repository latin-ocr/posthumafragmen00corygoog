CORYAT‘S eunomus

tome is continually uoed in this towne: so that they give
a certaine yearlie stipend to a fellow thet executeth this

office. Ι made my aboade in Rees all day the three and
twentieth of September being Friday, by reason that the
weather was so boysterous, and the Rhene so firmos
that there was no trav ' upon the river without grat
danger. But the foure an twentieth of September being
Saturday Ι departed therehence about sixe of the clocke
limiti· in the morning, and orme to Emricke a faire towne ol
Cleve-land sixe miles therehenoe and situate by the
Rhene, about nine of the clocke the same morning. ln
this towne Ι saw nothing memorable (for indeede that little
time that Ι spent there Ι bestowed in the refection of my
body, that I had no leisure to walke abroade) and there·
fore Ι will let it passe without any farther mention but
only the name. Ι departed therehence about noone the
same day, and orme about three of the clocke in the alteo
noone to the City of Nimmigen in Gelderland, bei nine

miles. ln my journey betwixt Emricke and Nimmigen
e. Ι saw the City of Cleve, in Latin Clivium, the Metro
politan of Cleve-land, situate afrrre off from the Rhene,
aprety way up in the country. It seemeth to be a faire
City. For it yeeldeth a beautifull shew afarre off. Also
Ι observed one very memorable thing about six miles on
this side Nimmigen, a certaine sconce in an island of the
Rhene called Skinlrelsconce. Ι heard that it is esteemed
[p. 633.] the strongest sconce of all Europe. It belongeth to the
States, and standeth in a certaine little lsland which was
converted to such an impre able fortification by the rare
invention of a certaine utchman whose name was
Skinkel, from whome the fort bath his denomination. lt
hapned that this Skinkel was afterwards drownod in the
river Waell neere the city of Nimmigen. The sconce is
joyned to the land on one side by a wooden bridge.
But now before Ι begin to write of the city of Nim-
migen, Ι will make some mention of the country wherein

it standeth. The Latine name is Geldria, but the vulgar
