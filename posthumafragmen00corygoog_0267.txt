CORYAT'S CRUDITIES
desirous to be cheefe amongst you, would by his forwerd-

nesse forestall the govemment 01 the armie, yee 've no
†eure at all unto him: and if he make as thou h ewere
sent from us, it is not true. Or if he sheweth letters sent
as from us, ye may say they are altogether false, that 1 may
not call them hutive. Ye ought to choose warlike men,

· and Chieftains ex rt in those affaires, and to take order

that the armie 0 the Lord may march together, that It

may ev where have strength, and may not sustaine

violenceeliom any whatsoever. For there was a certaine

man in the first voia e before Jerusalem was taken, called
Peter, 01 whome ye also (unlesse 1 am deceived) have often
heard mention. He marching alone with his soldiers,
exposed the people that believed him, to so great dangers,
that either none of them or very few esoaped, that perished
not either with hunger or the sword. Therefore it is
altogether to be feared that if yee shall doe the like, the
like may hap n unto you also. Which God turne from
you that is bessed 101 ever. Amen.

Having now ended those two thin that 1 said before

were the most memorable 01 all in the ody of this Chumh,
I will digresse to some other matter, and will first make

m us mention of a certain pulpit that standeth on the left hand

01 the body of this Chureh, as you come into it from the
street. 1 suppose that some hyper-critical] carpers will
taxe me of vanity 101 adding such triviall things to my
Observations, as descriptions 01 Pulpits. But 1 orave
pardon 01 them although 1 describe this pulpit of Spira.
For it was so glorious and resplendent an architectura, that
Ι was unwilling to let it passe unmentioned, being the
fairest thing 01 that nature that Ι saw in my travels, saving
one onely pulpit before mentioned in my discourse 01 the
City of Amiens. Which notwithstanding in some respects
is inferiour to this whereof Ι now speake. The roofe or
