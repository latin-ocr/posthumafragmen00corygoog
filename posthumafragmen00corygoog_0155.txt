CORYAT'S CRUDITIES

For here Ι saw many of them hanged upon the dores both

at the entrance into the City, and in the fairest streete.
These heads are of certaine wilde boares that the poople

doe kill in hunting in the forrests and woods of the coun-

try. Which hunting of wilde boares is more exercised

by the Germans then by any other Christian nation. And

it is the custome of the country whensoever they have
killed any great boare to cut off his head, and erect it in

that manner as Ι have already spoken. The like Ι ob-
served afterward in many other German Cities. Ι was in

the fairest Church of the City which is dedicated to our
Lady, where Ι saw a great many ictures and images for

. this City is wholly Papisticall) and one very curious tar
made of wainscot. On the south side of the Church
there standeth a little Chappell, wherein Ι saw an exceeding

iias multitude of dead mens bones and skulles laid together
s . at the west end thereof. lnever saw so many dead mens
bones together in all my life before. For the number of
thern was so great, that Ι thinke at the day of judgement

at the least ten thousand soules will challenge them.
Surely for what cause they heape together these bones (Ι

confesse) Ι know not.

of a certaine Lady to the Earles of Kyburg. Agame,
after the death of Hortmannus the last Earle of Kyburg,
who died about the yeare 1260, there rose a great conten-

· tion about this Earledome. Eut at last Rodolphus Earle
of Habspurg that was afterward elected King of the
Romanes‚ got the possession of it, and after his death it
was continually possessed by the Dukes of Austria till
the Councell of Constance. At what time the Helvetians
by the commandement of the Emperour Sigismund first
seised upon it, who have ever kept it from that time till
this da. ’
