magnificent building, whidi 1 think in times put was a

ι sc nole. Upon one side when-eof town-ds the Chutch
ιη tenne humanas, md in each space betwixt every uouple
of them is written one of the tenne Comnundements au
of them being comprehended in as many Latin verses.

the bestowing of munition. The, Proetnrium σι· rather

side of the mwne nea-e to their key 1 ohserved an unck-m
Castell built with bn'ckq md invironed with a faire wnll.
