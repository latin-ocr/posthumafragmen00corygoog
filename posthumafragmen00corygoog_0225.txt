CORYAT’S CRUDITIES

&1022th of which yeeldeth a notable Seminarie of learning. For

therein are read most of the liber-all sciences. The Princes
house is a very magnificent and beautifirll Pnlace, but it
was not my good hap to sruway the inward beauty thereof.
For no strangers can be permitted to enter into any of the
German Princes Palaces without great difficulty, whereof
Ι had experience againe afterward at Heidelberg at the
Court of the Count Palatine of Rhene. The Prince of
Baden was not resident in Turlowe when Ι was there, but
at his stately Castell of Milberg five miles from it, where
with oertaine German Earles and divers other noblemen
of the country, he solaced himselfe at hunting of Deere.
Ι saw the Castell a farre off, which seemed to bea building

of great strength and magnificence.
Thus much of Turlowe.

Departed from Turlowe the sixth day of September
bein Tuesday about eleven of the clocke in the morn-
ing, and came toa solitary house standing in the middle
way betwixt Turlowe and Heidelberg, about seven of the

clocke in the evening, where Ι lay that Anyght. This house

was fourteene miles eyond Turlowe. er Ι bad travelled
a quarter of a mile beyond Turlowe, Ι observed a matter

‘²²¹ that made me wonder. For Ι saw almost a thousand hay·
“⁸ makers dispersed abroade in several] eat meadowes about

the towne. The like Ι observed allt tday in my journey
forward. At the first sight of this Ι imagined that it was
their only hay-harvest, and that they had not mowed their
meadowes at all before that time: but after more mature
consideration of the matter, when as I called to my remem-
brance the late hay-harvest that I saw in Switzerland about
thirteene dayes before, Ι conceived that it was their seoond
harvest. For the fertilitieof their meadowes is such that
they mow them twise in a Sommer. The like whereof Ι
have noted in sundry places of En land: but in Germanic
it is much more common then with us, in so much that Ι
thinke they use it a hundred to one more then we in
England.
