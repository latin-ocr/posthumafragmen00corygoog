CORYAT'S CRUDITms

No where shzlt thou heare them but in the Diets of
Germany. Wilt thou hnve Ca mines of the great Empire
mightier then the successore o Alexnnder himselfe? No
where ahak thou find it but in Germany. Dost thou euve
the meat fumeus Tribunatu in the whole Empire, the shop
of the nuncient Roman justice, md as it were the Sessions
of the old Amphictyones of Greece? No where shalt thou
behold it but m Gerrunny. Good God, if for the behold-
ing of this most mered meeting those ancient hends of the
civill lnw could be remlled to the fruition of this viull
brath, Pupiniam, Paulus, Ulpianus, Pomponius, caius,
Julianus, and nll other sacred Mesters of the lawes could
returne into this world out of their ashes, truly 1 beleeve
they would mvell into the middle of Gen-many from the
Elysiam fields, yen I will say thet Asffaea he selfe the
Goddesse of justioe would descend with them from hmven

to place her habitation there also asnungst momll ment
But what shall Ῑ sny of the other fruits of travell?
where shalt thou more happily and studinusly attaine to
an the liberal sciences then in Germany, which doth excell
the nuncient E tians in the study of Geometrie, the
Hebrews in R gion, the Chaldaeus in Arithmetitke, the
Grecims in aJl nrts, the Romans in discipline, and in veriety
of mechanimll mdes, consmncy, and fortitude, all other
nations. Which the very εει-,ωριτε themselves how much
soever they envy us, are consu-ained to confesse inaug-re

their heuts. Bodin wrote this though he were v

spuring of the German pnite, the very truth it se
wresting the speech frum him, he wrote it 1 say, and
prodaimed it of the Germans with an open voice, out of
the Κίιῖἕάοῐῃο of France, Neither mn my other man
write o erwise of it. Let them behold so nmny learned
Athene in Gennanie, so many noble Universities, as thnt
of Vienna in Austria, uf Heidelbet in the Countie Pala-
n'ne, of Colen by the Rhene, os {nge iu Bohernin, of
Erdfurt and Jene in ’Πηλῆι-εἵς, of Leipzick, of Rostoek,
Louan, Fribur , In lstat, sil, Gripswnld, Tubingeu,
Mena, Winen g &nudastis-d, Konigsbexg‚ Julia, in the
