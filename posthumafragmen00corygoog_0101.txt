CORYAT'S CRUDITIES

Since therefore these things are true, why should any
man wonder that from the remotest regions of the
southerne world the Antipodes, and those whom all the
ttfsllltltlttltllllstllltblltllllss
offence‚ have of late yeares arrived in Germany‚ after an
infinite len th of travell to see our most valiant Nether-
landers? {gaine² why should an man wonder that not
only in the trme of the Empire odCharles the Great‚ but

‘'³³5'’ , ‚ ¹²¹· also no longer then seven yeares since, the Ambassadors

of the King of Persia came to our most Soveraigne Prince

'm' Mauritius to Cassels (which Peter Ramus commended at

Paris out of the Kings Professors chaire of the University,
and which in his writings he stiled by the name of a second
Syracusae where Archimedes dwelleth) being moved with
the fame of so worthy a Prince, whom all forr-aine Nations
and People doe admire and honour for the Phoenix of
his time, and from thence to have travelled through the
middle of Germany to our most invincible Emperour
Rodolph. It is even incredible to be reported how much
they admired the Cities and Townes of Germany‚ our
Princes territories, and the large bounds of the Empire‚
the strong Cities and Fortresses. I thinke there are some
in this company, that when they were commorant in this
Province with our most noble Prince for some certaine
dayes, and saw those Ambassadors, they heard how greatly
they commended the munition of Cassels, affirming that
there was not the like in all Persia. With what wonder
and astonishment they beheld the armoury, the rampiers
and trenches there, how they observed the magnificenoe

of the Palaces and Gardens, and how they commended the

ggnngpyhginrdoeregall gloryfttsf thedCtourt. For thelylle things
why should pgrmcaaynggngreyyrthg orilreriabeesing sdrbofleeri
publiquely sent from the innermost desarts of the Russians
and Moschovites came into Germany to behold the glory
