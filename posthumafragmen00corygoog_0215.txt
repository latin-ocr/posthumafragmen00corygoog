CORYAT'S CRUDITIES >

ΑΜ townes end of Strasbourg Ι passed a wooden bridge made
Μ’ ,Μ’ over the Rhene that was a thousand four score and sixe
mmm paces long. For Ι paced it. The longest bridge that ever
Ipassed. But it is nothing faire. or the boordes and
plankes are verie rudely compacted together. At one end
thereos there is erected a little house, where a certaine
officer of the ci dwelleth‚ that remayneth continually there
at the recei t oycustome to receive money of every stranger
that passeth that way for the maintenance of the brid e;
girehcommon pay being something lesse then our Englnh
t in .

Abobt sixe of the clocke in the afternoone Ι came to a
Protestant towne called Litenawe, where Ι lay that ni ht.
'sfhisbtowne is about sixteen English miles distant ἔσω

tras our.
En oh and But beiause Ι will from henceforth cease to use that
GfL'm often repetition of this word English in the computation
'¹¹¹ ³· of the German miles, 1 will exclude that word hereafter,
and put downe mile only: whereby I understand the
English mile, as much as if I did expresse the word.
For I am desirous to reduce the computation of the long
Dutch miles to our English account. My reason is,
because as Ι have already cast up the generall summe of all
the miles betwixt the lace where Ι was borne in Somerset-
shire and the Citie ol Venice, and that according to our
English miles: so likewise Ι determine after Ι come to
the end of Germanie, or arrive at London, to cast up the
number of al the miles betwixt Venice and my country
according to our ordinarie miles of England. But because
a man cannot altogether so precisely and exactly reduce the
German miles to our English, as to say the space between

two such Cities or townes containeth just so many English

miles, neither more nor lesse: 1 doe therefore aime and

give the nearest conjecture that Ι εαᾚ tracing of their
e

Helvetiae, ound. For this is my generall , to reduce an

fflffn and elvetiun mile which is the longest of all the German
mmm miles, to five English, being in some places of Switzerlnnd
nias. as much as s1xeo our miles: every mile betwixt the Cities
