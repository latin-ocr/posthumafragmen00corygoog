pleasant meadow about a nule on this side Curia, which
in my opinion contained about two hundred Actes.

My Observations of Curia,
Commonly called Chur‚ the Capitall Citie of Rhetia.

Uria is of some antiquitie, for it was built about the

years after the incarnation of Christ 3 54. at what time ·
Constantine the Emperour when he made warte against
the Alemannes, lodged his campe in this valley, and in the
same place where e citie now standeth, kept a kinde of
court or Sessions for the debating of the common affaires‚
wherehence the citie bein built a little after his departure,
had the name of Curia, hut it was often after that called
by the name of Augusta Rhetorum or Rhetica, as I have

. before written in my notes of Turia. It is seated under

an high Alpine Mountaine, and built in a triangular forme,
having on the east and south the steep Mountaines,
whereof those on the East are well planted with vine-
yards; on the west and north side is a oodly spacious

aine, especially that on the North, wherin the river

lilhene runneth, being about an English mile and halfe
distant from the citie. It is invironed with a faire wall,
having three gates therein, and adorned with certaine

pretty turrets that doe much beautifie the same. It was
converted to the faith of Christ shortly after the first
Thecathedral building thereos. The Cathedral Church is dedicated to

S: Martin, and was built by one Thello a Bishop of this
