GEORGE CORYAT’S POEMS

And in the field the Frenchmen forst to flee before his fiee,
Whiles Philip warin France doth hold: this dragon hed

such grace,

That in each fight from all the rest, the palme he still did

. And thegreetiore in his open mouth the bloudy hand is set
A Conquerour invincible; would he have bene more slacke
(Elizabeth) to hght for thee, and put thy enemies hacke?
But that the God who rules the Realm, & eke thy heuvenly
Makes iiilelideehjoy aquiet time? for thee he could not finde
Just muse to shew his manly heart. And now well smitte
He leaiheieathees’quiet gowne to d‘on‚ to him no werre
But thisahisiahegsht with eruell death, to whome he yeeldes
His woiihtyyghhst with triumphes joy in starry sky is set.
And as in life for good successe, a triumpher he was,

So now with glee into the heavens, the Dragons sprite doth

passe. ·

The conversion of the Triumph to the right
honourable Henry Earle of Pembroke his

sonne and heire.

Ut thou (my Country Lord) most worthy impe of
countres race,
Henry my L. reade thou these lines, turne hitherward thy
An hossgehf Fathers haughty acts, and honours to thy
Presentinihgrhselves his countenance in heart do thou fest

The ρεῗὲἓέῐῇὶςηεε of Pembrokes blood in thee do full
Thy facree’ntlssnzies' thy fathers looks, thy deeds shew his
wordes plain.
