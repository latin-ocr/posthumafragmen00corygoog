OBSERVATIONS OF HEIDELBERG

supported with εἰη huge stony pillnm strongly mmmed
into the water, and very fairely covered over had with an
nst-hed roos of timber-werke. At the further end whereof
there stnndeth a faire tower on the banke of the Neomr
which doth very much bautifie the bridge. This river is
commodianas to the City of Heidelberg in two

ts. First for that bei navigable it mieth ι kind

of rude bone called of the tinea ntis (such as I have
soene in divas other places of Germnny, and ¹1³0 in
Funce, used upon their ter rivers for carrying of ha ‚
timber, wood, διε.) whicfi is most commonly hden y
with timber for building‚ and part-leg with wood fin· fixe that
commeth out of the For-teet call Ottonim a part of the
Hercynia not farre from the city of Heidelb ; md by
this Neocar the said commndities are broug t lix-st to
Heidelberg for the furnishing of the ei ‚ and stom thnt
to the Rhene, where-*with it nu leth it se a little on thiu
aide Spita, and therehence to the westerne Cities and
townes situate on both sida of the Rhene as farre ns the
towne of Bing. Secondly, bemuse it ministrem t
nbunghnce of good fishes to the Ciry, especially the me
The Ci is strongly walled, and hnth foure fisse gaes
in the alfes, and one very goodly streete above the rat
both for bmdth and length. For it is nt the leuc nn
English mile long: md garnished with many beautifiall
houses, when-eof some have their fmnts fiii-ely painted,
which doe yeeld an excellent shew. Also it bath sixe
Chumhee. Namely that of the hely Ghost: St. Petere:
The Chul-ch in the Princes Pnlace: the Freneh Church: a
Chul-eh in the subm-bes: And the Predioetorie thurch
which belen once tn the Dominim Frias. But the
Chumh of e hul Ghost which ad‘oyneth to their great
mna-ket plnoe, is e fuis-est of all, hein beautified with
two singulu- ornaments :bove the other hun-‚hes that doe
greatly the sune: the one the Palatine Libade, the
other e monuments of their Princes. The Pnlntine
