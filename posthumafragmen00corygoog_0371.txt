was instituted in the eare 1388. under Pope Urban. lt
consisteth of three Cohedges, whereof Ι saw the sancientem

Ι observed a pretty towne on the other side of the

⁷ Ι Rhene called Teusch‚ which though 1 was not at it, but

onely saw it afarre off, Ι will mention for two mort
memorable matters that I have heard and read of it
The one is, that it is reported to have bene first inhabited
by ancient Tuisco otherwise called Teuto (whom I have
before mentioned) the sonne of the Patriarch Noahby
his wife Arezia3 who being sent by his father into thee
parts of Europe, made his residence in the same plaoc,
which is said to derive his denomination of Teusch from
this Teuto. Howbeit, Ι will not confidently avouch this
to berrue, thou h I depend upon the authority of a suffi-
cient author Sehastian Munster. Otherwise I will not
avouch it. The other, that there was an ancient oestell
built in that place by the Emperout Constantine, where
there lay a garrison of souldiers for the defence of the
Citie of Colen. I arn the sooner induced to beleeve this,
because it is verified by the testimony of Philip Melan·
thon‚ who writeth that there was a table found once in an
ancient Monastery of Teuch, wherein there was an inscrip
tion that confirmed this matter.

I cannot write of any famous bartels that have bene
fought neere this Citie, as I have done before of those by
Basil, Strasbourg, and Mentz: because Ι have neither
heard nor read of any. Onely I can say that it was once
much blemished by Attila King of the Hunnes, anda
long time after that by the Normanes in the time of the
Emperour Lotharius the second, who did much eclipse
