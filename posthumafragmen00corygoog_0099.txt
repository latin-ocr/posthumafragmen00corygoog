CORYAT’S CRUDITIES

of the Persian Ambassadors, which at that time were a
great miracle to our people, the East, aad Persia her selfe

that first gave them, having now received them againe
the Germanes, doth greatly

from the ands and witso

admire them, according as Augerius hath certified us.
But perhaps thou wilt say that Italy will shew thee

more auncient monuments, and more images of antiquity.

Report 1 pray thee (for I desire to hear rt) the rurnes of
auncient Theaters, the decayed pillars of the auncients,
and the fields where Troy was, as Virgil speaketh.

But (good God) Germany will resent unto thee many

answerable to the antiquity of the German Trevirs? if
thou dost looke upon the old ruines and mortar, the
auncient stones that have continued there even from the
time of the old Babylonian Ninus, doe present unto thee
the most true signes of walles built with pitch and slime.
If it pleaseth thee to behold the townes and buildings of

can be preferred before those of Germany. Can the sight
of Cannae, of Trebia, and Thrasimenus, that are so
famoused for Annibals victories and his slaughter of
the Romans, more delight thee then the Rhene and
Danubius, which for the space of three hundred years
bare the brunt of the Roman forces? Can those auncient
places of Italy minister more pleasure unto thee where
heretofore the Volsci, the Veientes, the Sabini, the
Hetrusci, inhabited, then those, where the auncient
