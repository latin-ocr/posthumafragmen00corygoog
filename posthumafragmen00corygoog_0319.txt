CORYAT'S CRUDITIRS

that infuseth it selfe into the Rhene, where they both do
make a confluent. This is one of the ganisan tornes
that l'have before mentioned, that were subject to the
Marshall of Mente, where there lay a company of pe·
sidiarie souldiers with a Roman Prefect, by the appoint-
ment of Julius Caesar, for the defence of that limit agnina
the Gennanes. There are three things that have much
famoused this towne. The first the death of Drusus Neo,
whom Ι have before mentioned. The second the Nunne
Hildegardis that once lived there. The third a towrr
standing in the Rhene, whereof anon Ι wil write a notable
0 historie. About the death of Drusus the historiens do

Germanes, sittin upon his horse. Others, that he perished
by a fall from lis horse. Which of these historieeis

I finde difference amongst the historiographers, Ι will not
certainly affirma, but leave it to the judgement of the
learned that are more expett in the Romane histories then
my selfe. But surely for mine owne parte I am drawen
by certain conjectures to beleeve that he died at this
towne. Amongst other reasons this is one: beeause there
is a certaine fountaine shewed to this day neate to this
towne (as Munster writeth) that is called Druselbrun‚ that
is, the fountaine of Drusus, as having his denomination
from the foresaid Drusus that died here. As for the
s. Hildegard. Nunne Hildegardis, she lived here about the yeare of our
Lord 1180, as Gesner writeth, and was of the order of St
Bennet‚ even in the time of St. Bernard Abbot of Clare·
vallis3 betwixt whom there was great friendship, as it
appeareth by their mutuall Epistles that they wrote to
each other, which are yet extant in the works of St
Bernard. Truly there are very admirable matters written
of this woman by the historians. For it is reported that
she was often rapt in the middest of her sleepe with
certaine enthusiasmes‚ that is, divine inspiratione, whereby
she learned the Latine tongue after a most miraculous
manner without any teacher. A thing that will seeme
