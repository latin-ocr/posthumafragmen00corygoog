have expressed a picture in this hoe, according to the
forme of it, as it flourished in tffe time of the Romnn
Monarchy. This word Amphitheam* is derived stom
these two Greeke words ἆμφὶ which siguifieth about. and
θεῶμαι to behold, because which way soever n mm doth
view it, he findeth it of ι circu-lar md round forme. So
that herein an Amphithenter differeth from s Thater,
because an Amphitheam is every where round, but ι
Thestei- (acmrding to the forme of the nuncient Roman
building) is but hnlfe round, bein rmde in the fishion of
en halfe circle or halfe Moune. he model of these kinde
of Amphithenters which the nuncient Romues built in
Rome, find other places of 1ffly, was derived stom the
Affienians, who were the first that erected ιιι Amphi-
theater. Certainly this present building, whereof 1 now
speak, is a most stupendious masse uf worke;

re rted unto me by Gentlemen οἵ good note in this citie
o Verona, that the like Amphithater is not to be scene
at this day in an Italy, no not in Rome it seife. Neyther
doe I thinke that antiquity could ever shew a fsyrer pieoe

this time. For the 'ncipnll ornaments thereos are
demolished and defle . So thet it hath lost more then
