Resides these two things last mentioned, the art of

&historio phers for three other matters. First the

fightinig olgra many famous battels neure to this city.
Secon y for certaine notable bridges built here over the

Rhene. Thirdly for the death of ert personages in the
(Μ W same City. The principall battes fought there were
ss'ffyl‘m'ga' {vergeli by the Romans: as by Drusus Nero whom I have

ore mentioned, who skirmished in this place with the

[p. 555] Germane. But this was not the place where he brake his
legge by falling from his horse, as some doe write. For

that mischance he had at the towne of Bing (as l will
hereafter mention) which is situate about some ten miles
beneath Mentz upon the left banke of the Rhene. Also
Aurelianus the sixe δι thirtieth Roman Emperor fought a

great battell here with the Franci* when he was but a yong

man, before he was chosen into the Empire‚ and in that
skirmish got a glorious victorie by slaying at the least

thirty thousand of them. Likewise the Emperour Otho
sumamed the Great, brought a great armie hither against

his rebellious sonne Ludolphus (whom 1 shall hereafter

daring’to skirmish with his father, contained himsllf within

the walles of the City, where after he had beene besieged

for the s ace of nine weekes, there was a truoe concluded

the first was built by Julian the Apostat the three and
fortieth Em erour of Rome, and is mentioned by Ammi-

anus Marcedinus the historiographo, which he caused to

be made after he had conquered the Alemannes about
Strasbourg‚ as I have before mentioned. After that battell
