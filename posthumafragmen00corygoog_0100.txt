IN PRAISE OF TRAVEL IN GERMANY

the Sicambri, the Bructeri, the Angrivarii, the Bavari‚
the Treviri, the Nervii, the Nemetes, the Triboci, the
Vangiones, the Ubii, the Frisii, the Cimbri, the Franci,
and other innumerable most glorious nations dweltl Doth
the memory of Scipio, Metellus, and Julius Cesar, more
deli ht thee then the statues of most valiant Ariovistus,
warhke Harminius, invincible Charles, couragious Roland,
glorious He , and of other heroicall Worthiesi but
why doe 1 up dead men to the stage? why doe I
speake of those that lie in the graves? admit that all these
things so worthy to be scene and heard, were wanting

whom would it not incite to travell into Germany, whom
would it not allure, whom would it not draw? which it
is written the famousest amon st the auncient Romans to
bave done, namely Pliny, iacitur, Julius, Augustus,
Tiberius, who vaunted that he travelled nine times out
of Italy into Germany. But what a kinde of solitarinesse
was there then of old Germany, what an unsbapen face,
what a roughnesse, so that if it be compared with the
present Germany, it seemeth to be made a goldcn and
marble country out of a leaden and wooden, even as Sylvius
hath testified, whose eyes the brightnesse of the Empire
and the German nation did so dazell, that he wrote this
to the men of his owne nation. Let us endevour that we
may bc called rather Germanes then Italians, but although
we cannot prevaile to bring that matter to sse, yet
howsoever let us direct our studies to that en , that we
may alwaies obey that famous nation. Adde unto all
these things the Germans frith and inte ity, and the most
refe secte of travelling. Italy is fu of a thousand
nucheries, of a thousand dangers, and Spaine also is as
full of them, whereof a man may most truly use that

woech

ι Mournin and dread in every place,
And dentis fell image shewes her face.
