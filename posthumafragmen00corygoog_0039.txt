fifty foot high, according to my estimation. These arches
were hereto ore distinguished with stately pillars of redde
marble answerable to the rest: and the highest degree of

the third was most gloriously beautified with faire statues
made of Corinthian worke, which were plaoed betwixt tbe
pillars and the arches3 every arch having two severall
statues, so that to double the number of the arches, which
are in al seventy, there were erected one hundred forty two
statues: which yeelded a passing ornament to the wall
Again, these three degrees of arches were built of as many
distinct formes of workmanship, namely the Corinthiun,
the lonicke and the Doricke. Also above these forcsaid
degrees there was a fourth ranke of building, which was
erected at the very toppe of all, viz. a degree of windowes
made all open, without either glasse or any other thing in
it. These corresponded the number of the arches, even

three ranks of three sever-all arches that 1 have already
mentioned, did round about inviron the whole buildi (as
l have before said) being some twenty foote distant m

well, and yeeldeth a most stately shew, though some
parts of the toppe be something blemished. For all the
arches doe as yet remaine, even seven two; for I walked
round about them, and tolde them . Now whereas of
the outward wal there were three de of arches, there
are not above two in this outward ,which stand directly
one above another, so that the number of those above
doth answere them beneath. And for the better grace of
the worke there is inserted betwixt every arch a goodly
pillar of red marble, the base whereof being made of the
same matter, is five foot thicke‚ and the distance betwixt
every couple of pillars is sixteene footc. The lower arches
are now converted to very base and sordid uses. For they
serve partly for stables to put horsea and hay in, and partly
