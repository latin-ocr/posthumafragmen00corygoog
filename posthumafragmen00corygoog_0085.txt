because a little arme of the noble river Rhene tunneth
through it. In this valley of Rhene Ι travelled tenne
miles. The Rhene which runneth through this valley,
flowes with such an extreme swiftnesse, that the water

cataractes, raiseth a certaine reaking mist to a eat heigth,
which proceedeth from the greate violence olgt the torrent.

one howre, then others in three. «

In many places of Rhetia‚ till Ι came into that part of
it which 1s almost wholy Protestant, Ι saw many little
Chappels built by the high way side (as in Savoy) tending
to Superstition3 as the picture of Christ, the Virgin Mary,
and sometimes of some Saints above the Altar.
