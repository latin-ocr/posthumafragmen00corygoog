CORYAT'S cRUDITms

the city of Norimber , told me as we sate together at
Epppessarthat pe certainngishop hadhtwo kinffiidwim in

sce ,a tteran aworse,tat were two
distinct names, the better Noli me tangere, the horse
Utcunque. And that a certaine merry conneited fellow
that satsat the Bishops table, having dranke once or twise
of the utcunque, so much disliked rt that he would drink
no more of it. Therefore he spake to one of the Bisho
servants that waited at table, to give him a draught of th:
Noli me tangere, ἃ withal pronounced unto him, in the
presence of the Bishop these two merry Latin verses ex
tempore.

Si ‚das Utcunque, daemon vos tollat utrunque:
Ibrs ad astra polr, si fers Me tangere noh.

With this and such other pleasant conceits we recreated
our selvcs that night at Uberwinter, and the next morning
being munday and the ninetecnth of September, we tookc
boate againe about three of the clocke, and cameto Colen
which was eighteene miles beyond it, about tenne of the
same morning: our whole journey betwixt Mentz and

Colen was about seventy eight miles. l observed ina

great many places, on oth„ sides of the Rhene, more
gallowcs and wheeles bctwixt Mente and Colen, then ever

saw in so short a space in all my life, especially within
few miles of Colen, by reason that the rusticall Corydons
of the country, which are commonly called the Boores and

Free-booten. the Free-bootcrs (a name that is grven unto the lewd

murderin villaines of the country that live by robbing
and spoyling of travellcrs, becing called Free booters,
because they have their booties and prey from passengers
free, paying nothing for· them except they are taken) do
commit many notorious robberies neere the Rhene, who
are such cruell and bloody horseleaches (the very Hyene
&Lycanthropi of Germany) that they seldome robbe any
man but forthwith they cut his throat. And some of
them doe afterward escape, by reason of the woodes neere
at hand in which they shelter themselves free from danger.
