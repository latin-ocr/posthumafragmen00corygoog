OBSERVATIONS OF FRANKFORT

his bodily cies. The goodh'est shew of ware that 1 mwe
in all Franckfnrd mving ὡκ of the Goldsmithea, wan made
by an Englishmsn one Thomas Sackfield a Dorsetshire-
mm, once a servant of my fsther, who went out of Englnnd
but in a mane estate, but after he had spent a few yenres
st the Duke of Brunswicks Coun, hee so inriched himselfe
of late, that his littei-in shewe of ware in chkford did
farre excell all e Du men, Freneh, Italia-ns, or whom-
soever else. This place is much frequented during the
whole time of the Mm with mm eminent and princely
persons. There 1 saw the Earle ο Seouenberg one of the
most potent Eules of ull Germmy. For his yeuly
revenues :re (ns Ι heard) about forty thousand pound
sterling. Also Ι sawe many other Enrles aud some Palm
graves: the number of whome is much multiplied (Ι
understand) in Genus-ny. The reason whereof is beaute
if nn Landgrave, Psaltzgnve, or Earle, harh nny sennes,
all οἶ them more or lesse do shsre in dignity. For all the
Lm ves sons if he nath ten or twenty, are land ves
u w as himselfe. The like doth happen to the Μὶν
graves, Eules &c- But dehosfilh their dignity be equell,
yet their euntes sse v uneq . For it fal-leth out vey
often tint the eldest rother bath almost al, md many
of the younger brothers but small memet of mnintenanoe.
After this 1 went to the Bookeseuers streete where I
nw meh infinite abundante of bookeo, that 1 tly
ndmired it, For this street farre excelleth Pnules C umh-
yard in London, Saint James sneete in Pais, the Meroeriz
of Venice, and all whatsoever else thu 1 snwe in my mvels.
In so much thst it seemeth to be n very epitome of sl] the
' pall Libraries of Europe. Neither is that streete
us for selling bookes onely, and that of nil manner of
mes md disciplina whtsoever, but also for prin ” of
them. 'For tius city hath so flourished within these
