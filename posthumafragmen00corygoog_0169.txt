CORYAT'S CRUDITIES

August, and earne to Basil, sixe English miles beyond it,
about nine of the clocke. In this space Ι observed a great

My Observations of Basil, in Latine Basilea.

His noble citie is situate in that most fertile territorie

of Sungovia heretofore called Se uenia, borderin

upon the confines of Switzerland, which t ough it stande
not in the province of Helvetia, yet it is reputed one of
the Helvetical Cities, both because it confineth upon the
frontires of the country, and also for that it was incor-
ffintffi lhta⁶t¹¹ftlfiffh⁰hy³⁰mhlth thath&
maugre all her enemies, and embraceth that popular
overnment that the other cities doe. Who was the first
iounder of it Ι cannot certainly finde. For Ι have not
read it in any author. But Ι conjecture that it began to
be built shortly after the dilapidations and ruines of the
ancient Citie of *Augusta Rauracorum, which was built

:mmm not farre from this Citre hythe same noble Roman Gentle-

man that was the founder of the Citieos Lyons, Munatius
Plancus, whom I have before mentioned. The ruines of
which Citie are shewed at this day as notable monuments
of the antiquitie and beautie thereos, when it flourished in
ancient times. From this Citie Augusta was Basil also
heretofore called Augusta Rauracorum. Truly it is very
likely that the founders of this Citie of Basil first derived
much of the matter for the founding and beautifying of
their Citie from the foresaid Augusta. In regard whereof
the Citizens of Basil have very lately erected a most
beautiful] statue of the foresaid Munatius Plancus made
of wood in his military ornaments, which Ι saw placed
upon a wooden pillar in the court of their Senate house,
and honored with a learned Elogium. Monster proveth
out of the thirtieth hooke of the histories of Ammianus

*This City or at the least the Rudera thereos now remaining are at
this day called Auget.
