Hujus ad exemplum juvenes florentibus annis
vivere rite Deo discite, rite mori.

May nabe Many other notable epitaphes Ι saw there, which the

‘Wh- shortnesse of my aboade in Basil and the urgent occasions
of calling me away therehence would not permit me to
write out, as of Hierom Frobcnius, and Michael Isingrius,
two famous printers of the citie, &o But what is now
wanting, Ι hope shall be hereafter supplied; for by Gods
grace Ι will one day see Basil againe.

But one most elegant epitaph I will adde, which is to be
found in this citie, and very memorable both for the fame
of the person upon whome it was made, and the worthi-
nesse of the Author that composed it. There was given
me by a learned man, a student of the Universitie (of
whome Ι was inquisitive for the antiquities of the citie)
this excellent epitaph which he told me is extant ina
Church of the lesser Basil beyond the Rhene that belonged
once to the Carthusian Monkes, made upon the death of
that famous Civilian Ludovicus Pontanus a Roman borne,
who died of the plague in this citie of Basil, anno 1439.
at the time of the generall Councell celebrated here: the
author hereos was AEneas Sylvius who was afterward
Bishop of Rome (as I have before written) by the name

of Pius Secundus, the learnedest Pope that hath beene
these thousand yeares. The Epitaph is this.

Si mille aut totidem rapuisses usque virorum
Pestis, adhuc poteram parcere saeva tibi.
Vivens quo nusquam fuerat praestantior alter,

Extinctum potius reddis iniqua lues.
Qem fletis leges, quem fletis jura, sacrique
Nunc Canones: obiit, quem coluistis, herus.
Hic vos orndrat, vestras, ubicunque fuerunt,
Solverat ambagest nunc sine voce jacet.
