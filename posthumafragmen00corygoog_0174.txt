OBSERVATIONS OF BASLE

these is inferiour to this: only Ι except a part of the
Church of Strasbourg, namely the tower, which Ι will
hereafter describe3 for Ι attri ute so much to the same,

that Ι give the superiority unto it not onl of all those
towers that I saw in my whole voyage, but so of all other

towers whatsoever in Christendome, as Ι have heard v

learned and famous travellers report that have scene bo

that and the fairest towers of Europe. But to returne to

this glorious and most elegant Church of Basil the very
Quaene of all the German Churches that Ι saw, accordin The qums
ss Ι have before intitled our Lady Church at Amiens ol ‘m'
the French Churches3 truly Ι extollit so hi hly that 1‘ π ⁸⁸
esteeme it the most beautifull Protestant Ch that ever

Ι saw, saving our two in London of Paules and West·
minster, which doe very little excell this in beauty (though
something in estnesse) if any thin at all. The body

of it is garnishled with two rowes ofgoodly pillars, sixe

in a side. Also it is beautified with a very fatre paire of
Organs that are decked with passing curious wainscot
worke, and a ve sumptuous Pulpit adorned with a most

excellent thim o workemanship of wainscot also. Like-

wise at West end of the body there are two very

stately rowes of seates made of wainscot with very exquis-

ite workemanship, and most artificiall devices in the same.

Over the which are raised three· curious borders, in the

middle whereof ¹which is advanced to a very convenient

heigth, this im resse or inscription is written in golden Imm
letters upon a blacke ground. ’Μ '¹‘ m·
