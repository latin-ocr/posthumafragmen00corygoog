OBSERVATIONS OF COLOGNE

common, so very ancient. Neither doth this make nt all
ιο the matter, dut the Evangelist hath not called them
Kings, but Magi. For that was done to great purpose, in
regu-d that Christes glory end mu· reli 'on seemed to bee

established ratha- by the testimony of ⁴ or Wisemen,
then by the power of Kings.
4. As oon ” thei: profensiom albeit there axe some

that by the name o Magi doe understand wicked persons,
and those that prmise magicke artes: yet the opinion of
them ought tu vaile more with us that thinke they
were wise Amoss‘gm, who by the Mnhenmicke ut g:
C 'an speaketh) knew the force and course of

P ets, and by carmine rules of experiente observati the
nature of the Elements, md the offices of the sumn.
Whmhenoe it eume very mnvenimtly to pesse that the
divine Wisedome, which duth sweetly dispose all things,
dxew them untn it especially by the token of ι smne, u
being men skilfull in the nne of Astronomy: whereunto
vu added both the light of the Divine ‚ md also ι
dunense-satior: of men out of the holy 'latui-es. For
they were instructed by the Suibes out of the Pro het
Micheas concerning the place where Christ sho be
borne, and they received it ns n cen-taine tudition οἱ their
fiaresnthers out ns the Pro hecy of Balaam, that the same
stane did signifie the birt of the Messias.

5. That ame out of Arabia Foelix (ιε Justin
Martyr, Ter ' n, C fian, and Epiphanius have written)
it seemeth very proba e. Both because Arabis, in respect
of Judea, is situate town-ds the East (aoeoedin to the
testimony of Tacitus) md ulso because it de plenty
of gold, frankencense, and myrrhe. Fi y for that this
o inion doth agree with the Prophecie of Esny. All they
ο Saba (which is Arabia, ss Hierum doth witnesne upon
the lace, md in the booke of his Qations upon Geumis

come, and hrin gold and fi-ankencence. And wi
that of the Pro het fivid. The Kingee of the Arabiane
md of Saba sh bring 'fts. And againe, untu him shall
they give of the gold o Arabia.
