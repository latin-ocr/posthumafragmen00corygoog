OBSERVATIONS OF ST. GOAR

and met-timent u henrt mn conceive for the incorporating
of n fresh novice into the fraterni of boone companions.
And from thenoefnrth he is free m an such muner of
exactions a: long as he liveth. Thu this is true 1 know
by mine owne experienoe. For I wns contented for
novelty sake to be their prisoner a litle while by wearing
of the fon-mid collar. This custome dnth some
kinde of affinity with cermine socinble ceremonies nt wee
have in a place of Euglnnd which are performed hy that
mose reverend Lord Ball of Bagshot in Hamptshire, who
doch with many and indeed more solemne rites invent his
Brothers of his unhallowed Chappell of aningstone ξε
nll mu· men of the ναίει-ηε parts of England do know y
dem-e experiente to the θωπί of their purses en these
merry Burgomaisters of Saint Gewere use to oe. In this
towne wns 1 like to sepmte my selfe from my Moguntine
company. For as soene as I heard that the temne did

belong to the Landgrave of Husin, the very name of that mam

ποι-ὼγ Prinne (whome for his admirable wisedome they
do not undesexvedly stile with the title of the Solnmon
of German ) did mike into mee such n longin desire
to see his gom-t at Cassel, that I was with great AEfficulty
withdnwne by the perswnsions of my compnny stom goi-ng
thither. For he is fl Prinoe uf such rue and minmlous
ifts of learning (the smne whereas when I was in Germ-ny
{id doctorum volitare per orn virorum, und exmdingly
remunded fure md nem-e in the enses of 211 lamed men)
thet next to my dread Sovemigne King, und hi: gratinus
son Prinne Hem-y, the most unpanlleled father and mnne
of anthe Christian world, 1 do most honour and rever-enee
the memory of this learned and religione Prinne. For his
religion to ther with the &nme that is genenlly profe-sed
over his w ule dominion‚ is flltogether consonent to oure
in Enghnd. And his leuning is so mre (becing confirmed
by the testimonies of thnusands of the learneder sort)
that he speuketh sixe nr seven languagea most elegantly,
Et his affection to Englishmen is so gre-t, that no stan
of any part of Chrinendome ean bee more welmme to him
