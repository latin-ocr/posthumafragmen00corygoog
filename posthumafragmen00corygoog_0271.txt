within the which is described the history of Christs praying
upon the Mount Olivet, for there he is represented pro
strate upon his knees, and elevating his hands when he
prayed to his Father. Also three of his disciples are
pourtraied sleeping in as many several places apart. The

Mount Olivet and the Chappell within the same. To
conclude, such is the strange curiositie of this worke, that
it driveth all the beholders into admiration, and is a thing
of such fame that few strangers come to the Citie but see
it before they goe forth againe.
