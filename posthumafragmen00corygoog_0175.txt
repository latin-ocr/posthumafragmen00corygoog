. CORYAT‘S CRUDITIES

Eundem ipsi pit devotique
observantia,
summisse consecrare
volvit.

Truly Ι observed every thing in the body of this Church
disposed in such a comely order, and so trimly kept, that
it did even ticlde my soule with spiritur-ll joy to behold
the same, and so Ι thinke it will every zealous and godly
Protestant, in so much that Ι did even congr-utulate and
applaude the religious industry of the Basihans. And Ι
am perswaded that one godly prayer pronounced in this
Church by a penitent and contrite-hearted Christian in
the holy Congregation of the citizens, to the omnipotent
Jehovah through the only mediation of his sonne Jesus
Christ, is of more efficacy, and doth sooner penetrate into
the eures of the Lord, then a centurie yea a whole myriad
of Ave Maries mumbled out upon beads in that super-
stitious manner as Ι have often seene at the glittering
Altars of the Popish Churches. The Qire is very
decently graced with many faire pillars, and the frontispice
thereof marvailously adorned with gilt scutchins and armes
of divers royal and Princely Potentates. On the left hand
of the body of the Church as you enter into the Quire, Ι

o saw the Sepulcher of that thrise-famous Erasmus Rotero-
umus. damus that Phoenix of Christendome, and well deserving

man of the common-weale of learning, who was so

2. delighted with the noble City of Basil, that he studied

here many yeares together, being a great benefactor to the
City as Ι wil hereafter mention, and at last finished his life
in the same. His body lieth interred under a flat stone,
neure to the which is erected a beautifull pillar of red
marble about three yardes high (accordin to my estima-
tion) two foot thicke, and an eil broad, at the toppe
whereof the effi ies of his face is expressed, with this
word Terminus ihy which impresse Ι thinke is meant that
death is the end of all things) written under it in golden
letters: and under the same this epitaph cut in golden

letters also. 8
