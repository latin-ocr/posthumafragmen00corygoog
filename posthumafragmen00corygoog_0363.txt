CORYAT’S cRUnrrms

mittas: δι adolescenti ui in honorem tuum hanc oratiun-
culam composuit, mi ‘que in omnibus adversitatibus
succerrere digneris. Amen. Under the prayer this is
written with a pen. 1607. 17. Mensis Aprilis.

(Μ of the Next 1 went to the Church of the Maccabees, in which
Maeones. they report the Bones of that holy mother of the Macor-
bees and her seven sonnes doe lye, that were with such
most horrible and exquisite tortures punished by '
Antiochus before the incarnation of Christ, as it appeare
at large in the seventh chapter of the second booke of the

heads with their haire3 and lastly were fiyed in a fiying
pan, only because they would este no swines flesh. Cer·
tainely this monument is v memorable, and worthy to
be seene by a curious traveeller, if a man were sure that
these were the true bones of them. For truly for my
owne part 1 will confesse, 1 love to see these kind ol
things as much as any man living, especially when 1 am
perswaded that there is no delusion. But indeed there is
so great uncertainty in these Papisticall reliques, that a
man cannot certainly tell which are true, and which are
hlse. Over the dore as 1 entred the Court that leadeth
to the Church, Ι observed the image of the mother and
her seven sonnes boyled in a cauldron, with the flames
of fire under it, and beneath the image this inscription is

written.

Salomona vocor cocta sartagine,
Cum liberis litor ignis aspergine,
Agens moestissimum Deiparae typum.

Under another image also in the same front, this is
written.

Unda Rheni rosea fit sanguinis madore,
Corpora Ἧι 'nea hle ensis stant in ore,
Dat Praesul einoldus Maccabeis sedem.
