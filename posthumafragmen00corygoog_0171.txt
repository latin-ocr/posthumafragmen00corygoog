Germanes md Helvetium observed this rule in former
times nt the founding of their Citis, thzt when they laid
the foundntion of any eicie hard by any fimens river, they
built one port of it on one bflnke of the seme river, end
the other on the opposite bnnke. Which thing 1 have
soene with mine σπῆι eyes in three Helvetia-ll αἰκία,
nnmely, in Zurich situm by the ffiresaid Lim-cus, Badeo
by the nme river, and this citie of Basil by the Rhene3
