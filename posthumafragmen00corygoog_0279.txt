CORYAT’S CRUDITIES

each of these two hundred Townes and Villages have

seemed so strange unto me, that I have neither read nor
heard of the like to be observed in so small a plotte oi
§oppid-City is esteemed of great antiquity. For some
authors doe write that it was a colonie of the Trevirians,
and that it be ne to be built within a few yeares aseer
