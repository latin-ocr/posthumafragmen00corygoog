discoursin <fanis huge vessel. For ss it ω e sti-angen
spectac-le t t Ι saw in my travels: so 1 hope it will not be
unpleesant unte thee to rende fl ful desa-iptiuu of all the

tter-ne that 1 brought with me from the ity of Franck-

This strange newes perhaps will seeme utterly intredliffle
to thee ιῑ the first: but 1 would have thee beleeve it.
