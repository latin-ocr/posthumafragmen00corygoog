CORYAT’S CRUD'ITIES

This towne Desentianum is situate neate to the y
lake Garda heretofore called Benacus, which Virgilorribiir·

tioneth in these wordes:
Fluctibus, δι stemitu assurgens Benace marino.

The first name Benacus was imposed upon it from a towne

so called, and also the new name Garda from a towne
situate neate to it, which retaineth that name at this day.

' This lake is called in the Italian Lago di Gardo; it is said
‘²' · to be thirty five miles long, andin some places fourteene

broad. 1 heard that it is commonly esteemed the noblest
Lake of all Italy, and some doe not sticke to preferre it
before the famous Lacus Larius, now called di Como.
The faire River Mincius that runneth by antua (of
whom Ι have before made mention) issueth out of this
Lake: it is oftentimes very rough and boysterous inso-
much that at sometimes of the yeare it is very dangerous
for passengers to passe that way. The cause of which
roughnesse is ascribed unto the high cliffes that inclose it
on both sides, and interclude the wintine, who having not
the liberty there as in the open sea, doe extremely tosse
up and downe the waters. It yeeldeth lden sands like
those of Tagus by Lisbone, and Pactoliis by Sardis in
Lydia. Also it aboundeth with fish, especially Carpes,
Troutes, and Eeles. This lake is very memorable for one
thing, to wit, for a famous victory gotten near unto it of
the Germanes, by that worthy and victorious Emperour
Flavius Claudius the successor of Galien, of whom the
Historians do write he partly slew and partly tooke captive
two hundred thousand.
l departed from Desentianum the next day bei

munday‚ and the fifteenth day of August about seveniil
the clocke in the morning, and came to Brixia, commonly

rs ·. mlled Bressa, being eighteene miles beyond it, about two

of the clocke in the afternoone: in which space I observed

nothing memorable, but onely some few ruinous Castles,

which seeme to be buildings of great antiquity.
